  <h2><a name="1-INTRO"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>The text input file formats of GEMIPM2K program, in general,
correspond to three data structures that keep the definition of
chemical system (DATACH structure) and work data of GEM IPM algorithm
(MULTI structure),
with part of data that change from node to node exchanged through the
DATABR ("data bridge recipe") structure. Accordingly, the input
consists of
three file types: the DCH, the IPM and the DBR. All these
files have the same <a href="#FREEDATA">free-text data format</a>. The
files can be typed using any ASCII text editor, or easily produced from
and SysEq record (calculated equilibrium state) in the GEM-Selektor
package. To do the latter, simply open a SysEq record in "Single
Thermodynamic System" dialog and re-calculate it. Then select a menu
command "Data" "Write GEMIPM2K files ..." and follow the appearing
dialogs. <br>
  </p>
  <p>The contents of DCH file, read only once at the initialization of
the GEMIPM2K session, are copied into both DATACH and MULTI
memory structures. <br>
  </p>
  <p>The IPM file contains the data that are irrelevant for the
mass-transport part; it is read once after the DCH file, and the
contents are sent into the MULTI memory structure. The IPM file
contains <a href="gems_ipm.html">numerical settings of the GEM IPM
algorithm</a>, as well as the parameters of non-ideal mixing models in
phases-solutions, and/or properties of
sorption phases and surface complexes belonging to them. <br>
  </p>
  <p>Finally, one or many DBR files contain the data for bulk
composition,
temperature, pressure, and metastability constraints (GEM input). At
the same time, such files when written by GEM-Selektor or (coupled)
GEMIPM2K code, contain the GEM equilibrium speciation results (output)
such as the dual solution (vector u), primal solution
(speciation), activity coefficients, amounts and bulk compositions of
phases. <br>

  <h2><a name="2-INPUTFILES"></a>2. Input Files Needed to Run a
Standalone GEMIPM2K Calculation<br>
  </h2>
  <p><br>
The test examples of usage of GEMIPM2K on the TNode and TNodeArray
levels can be executed with the
following command line: <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">gemnode.exe
&lt;TestDir&gt;/&lt;TaskName&gt;-dat.lst &gt;
&lt;TaskName&gt;.out</span><br>
  <br>
where <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TestDir&gt;</span> is
an optional subdirectory path; <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TaskName&gt;</span>
should be substituted by a string denoting the
problem name, e.g. <span style="font-family: monospace;">"MyTask"</span>.
  <span style="font-family: monospace;"></span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"></span> The file <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TaskName&gt;.out</span> will
contain console output of the program, redirected there during
execution of the
TNode example. Without this redirection, the output can be found in a
terminal (Linux) or lost (Windows). <br>
  </p>
  <p>The simplest example of the command line (under Windows) to call
the GEMIPM2K example on TNode level looks like</p>
  <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">gemnode.exe
MyTestData/mytask-dat.lst &gt; mytask.out<br>
  </span></p>
  <p>The file <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TaskName&gt;-dat.lst</span>
must have the following contents (also automatically created by default
upon file
generation from the GEMS-PSI code):<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">-t "&lt;TaskName&gt;-dch.dat"
"&lt;TaskName&gt;-ipm.dat"
"&lt;TaskName&gt;-dbr-&lt;node0&gt;.dat"[,
"&lt;TaskName&gt;-dbr-&lt;node1&gt;.dat", ... ]</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
  <br>
This is simply the list of all files prepared for the GEMIPM2K input;
all these files must be located in the same directory where the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">*-dat.lst</span> file itself is
located.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
  <p> The <span style="font-family: monospace;">-t</span>
command-line key tells that the following <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TaskName&gt;-dch.dat,</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"> &lt;TaskName&gt;-ipm.dat,</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">
&lt;TaskName&gt;-dbr-&lt;node0&gt;.dat</span> files, and so on, are
prepared in
free-text input format. Alternative command-line key is <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">-b</span>
(the files are prepared in binary format - this can only be done from
GEMS-PSI code, or the files were written from the GEMIPM2K). In this
case, when the file set is written by GEMS code, the file <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TaskName&gt;-bin.lst will be
generated having the following content:<br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">-b
"&lt;TaskName&gt;-dch.bin"
"&lt;TaskName&gt;.ipm"
"&lt;TaskName&gt;-dbr-&lt;node0&gt;.bin"[,
"&lt;TaskName&gt;-dbr-&lt;node1&gt;.bin", ... ]</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
  </p>
  <p>The first file in the list, <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TaskName&gt;<a
 href="gemipm2k-inp.html#DATACH">-dch.dat</a></span>, (or <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TaskName&gt;-dch.bin</span>)
contains input
data for the
chemical system definition (CSD) that can be used by both GEM and the
mass transport parts of the coupled code (see example in the file <a
 href="../txt/dch-dat-doc.txt"><span style="font-family: monospace;">dch-dat-doc.txt</span></a>).
These data are also needed for reading/writing the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">*-dbr.dat</span> files (see below). <br>
  </p>
  <p>The second file in the list, <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TaskName&gt;<a
 href="#GEMIPM">-ipm.dat</a></span>, contains input data that are used
internally by the GEM IPM kernel and must not be exchanged with the
mass transport part. This file also contains the flags and values for
the numerical setup of GEM IPM subroutines, such as the convergence
threshold. <br>
  </p>
  <p>There can be one or many comma-separated file
names of <a href="#DATABR"><span style="font-family: monospace;">*-dbr.dat</span></a>&nbsp;
(node description) type, which will be read sequentially. On the
TNodeArray level, these files contain composition and speciation of all
chemical systems needed to set up the initial conditions for the mass
transport modelling. On the TNode level, in principle, one <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">*-dbr.dat</span> file is sufficient;
if there are many such file names then they will be read one by one,
but only the last one will remain in the work DATABR structure in the
program memory. See an example of <span style="font-family: monospace;">*-dbr.dat</span>
file in the file <a href="../txt/dbr-dat-doc.txt"><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">dbr-dat-doc-txt</span></a>.<br>
  <br>
To summarize, the GEMIPM2K will read input text files specified
in
the command line in the following order: <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TaskName&gt;-dat.lst</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TaskName&gt;-dch.dat</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TaskName&gt;-ipm.dat</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TaskName&gt;-dbr-&lt;node0&gt;.dat</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">............</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TaskName&gt;-dbr-&lt;nodeN&gt;.dat</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
  <br>
As an option, the files can be read in in the
binary
format ( <span style="font-family: monospace;">-b</span> key in the
file <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TaskName&gt;-bin.lst</span>)
in the following sequence:<br>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TaskName&gt;-bin.lst</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TaskName&gt;-dch.bin</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TaskName&gt;.ipm</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TaskName&gt;-dbr-&lt;node0&gt;.bin</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">............</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;TaskName&gt;-dbr-&lt;nodeN&gt;.bin</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
  </p>
  <p>The whole collection of GEMIPM2K input files describing the
chemical
system for starting the coupled examples can be written directly from
the GEMS-PSI code (either in GEM2MT module or, for a single equilibrium
system, from the GEMS Single Thermodynamic System dialog, the "Data"
"Write
IPM ..." menu command). <br>
  <br>
Later on, the text input files can be modified by the user according to
descriptions of free-input file formats found in the accompanying files
  <a style="font-family: monospace;" href="../txt/dch-dat-doc.txt">dch-dat-doc.txt</a><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">, </span><a
 style="font-family: monospace;" href="../txt/ipm-dat-doc.txt">ipm-dat-doc.txt</a><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">,</span> and <a
 style="font-family: monospace;" href="../txt/dbr-dat-doc.txt">dbr-dat-doc.txt</a>.
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>The <a href="#FREEDATA">format of
these file types</a> is essentially the same, only the data tags and
fields
differ. <span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">The file consists of
two sections - the "dimensions" section
where the data needed for memory allocation in GEMIPM2K are provided,
and the "free-data" section which follows next. The two sections are
separated by a keyword tag</span><br style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: monospace; color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">&lt;END_DIM&gt;</p>
  <p style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">Each data object consists of a
name tag (e.g., &lt;nDCinPH&gt;),
followed by space- or end-line -separated data elements (numbers,
strings etc.), quantity and order of which is defined by the object and
its dimensionality. When text files are printed from GEMS-PSI, each
data object entry also has a comment line that begins with '#'
character. So, the data object entry typically looks like this: <br>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-family: monospace; color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">#
nDCinPH: Vector L1 telling
how many DCs is included in each phase</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace; color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">
  <span style="font-family: monospace; color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">&lt;nDCinPH&gt;</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace; color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">
  <span style="font-family: monospace; color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">19 4 1
1 1 1 1 </span><br>
  </p>
  <p>The data object entries can follow in any order if they are
located after the <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;END_DIM&gt;</span>
keyword. However, within a data object entry, the values must follow
the tag (after space or new-line) and the order is strict. Comment
lines are ignored by GEMIPM2K. <br>
  </p>
  <p>Many data object entries can be skipped (especially in the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">*-ipm.dat</span> file), in which case
the default values will be used automatically by GEMIPM2K. The data
objects without default values must always be provided at input (they
are marked accordingly in the file format documentation files).<br>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
  <h3><a name="DATACH"></a>2.1. The DCH File with
Chemical System Definition</h3>
  <p>The DCH text input file should be read before the IPM
file and the DBR files.<br>
  </p>
  <p>The file &lt;TaskName&gt;-dch.dat contains parts of chemical
system
definitions (CSD) that can be requested both by GEM and by the FMT
parts of the coupled code. Contents of this file will be placed in two
memory data structures: (1) DCH structure visible from both GEMIPM
and the FMT part and (2) MULTI structure - the internal work structure
of GEM IPM, not visible from the FMT part. The &lt;TaskName&gt;-dch.dat
(and the DATACH structure) also contain dimensions and index lists that
are needed for reading and accessing the DBR (node description)
files like &lt;TaskName&gt;-dbr-&lt;node0&gt;.dat. Finally, the DCH
file and structure contains grid arrays of thermodynamic data used
later on for automatic interpolation of gibbs energies G0, molar
volumes V0<span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">, absolute entropy
function S0 and other look-up grid arrays of thermodynamic data&nbsp;</span>
of components to given values of temperature T and pressure
P in GEM IPM calculations for any node and time. </p>
  <p> The DCH text input file consists of nine sections, of which
sections (1), (2)<span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">,&nbsp; and (3)</span>
contain dimensions needed for
memory allocation must appear before the <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;END_DIM&gt;</span> tag. Any
other data object fields can appear after this tag in any order, and
some data objects can be skipped. If the data object tag is not found
in the input file, its elements will be assigned default values, if
possible. <br>
  </p>
  <p>It is recommended to place the input data&nbsp; in logical
sections as printed from the GEMS code. The section (4) <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">contains databridge configuration
section</span>; section (5) contains
names and some data for independent components (IC); section (6)
contains names and data for the dependent components (DC); section (7)
contains names and data for phases; the section (8) <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">stoichiometry matrix A</span>, and the
section (9) contains the lookup arrays
for interpolation of thermodynamic data for DCs. <br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <h3><a name="GEMIPM"></a>2.2. The IPM File with
GEMIPM Numerical Settings, Optional Sorption and Solution Model
Parameters<br>
  </h3>
&nbsp;The IPM text input file for GEM-IPM specific data is usually
generated from GEM-Selektor package. The GEMIPM2K program reads
this file after the DCH file and before any DBR file.<br>
  <br>
The file &lt;TaskName&gt;-ipm.dat contains additional data and
numerical controls from the IPM (MULTI) data strucutre that are
necessary for
the GEM IPM algorithm but are not relevant for the FMT part. As an
option, the whole binary MULTI structure can be read from the
&lt;TaskName&gt;.ipm binary file if the -b key is set at the beginning
in the &lt;TaskName&gt;-dat.lst file.<br>
  <br>
The IPM file is complementary to the DCH file. The IPM file
contains parts of chemical system definitions (CSD) that are&nbsp; used
by GEM IPM part but should not visible to the FMT part of the coupled
code. <br>
  <br>
The IPM text input file consists of <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">eight </span>sections, of which&nbsp;
section (1) contains numerical controls of GEM IPM algorithm
operation&nbsp; and convergence; section (2) contains dimensionalities
for additional memory allocation for surface complexes (main
dimensionalities of the&nbsp; chemical system are given in DATACH
file); section <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">(3) contains
tolerances and controls of the numerical behavior of GEM IPM-2 kernel;
section (4) defines the presence and data for mixing models of
multi-component phases and,&nbsp; if necessary, the arrays of
non-ideality parameters; sections (5)</span> to (6) provides some
complete
data arrays that may be incomplete in DATABR file(s); section (7)
contains some initial data for phases; and, finally, section (8)
contains initial data for sorption (surface&nbsp; complexation) phases,
present if set so in section (2). <br>
  <br>
Sections (1) and (2) contain flags and dimensions needed for
optional memory allocation which must appear before the <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;END_DIM&gt;</span>
tag. Any other data object fields can appear after this tag in any
order, and some data objects can be skipped. If the data object tag is
not found in the input file, its elements will be assigned default
values, if possible. It is recommended to place the input data&nbsp; in
logical sections as printed from GEMS code.<br>
  <br>
  <h3><a name="DATABR"></a>2.3. The DBR File with Node
Data Bridge Composition and Speciation Data<br>
  </h3>
The DBR text input file for DATABR (node recipe) data can also
be generated by GEM-Selektor. The GEMIPM2K program reads such files
after the DCH
and IPM files. <br>
  <br>
The DATABR data structure comprises the interface ("data bridge
recipe") for
coupling mass transport and chemistry (see DATABR.H
file).<br>
  <br>
The file &lt;TaskName&gt;-dbr-&lt;node0&gt;.dat (read into the DATABR
memory structure) contains parts of the chemical system definition that
may be changed by the FMT part (input data of GEM such as T, P, bulk
composition, metastability constraints) or are returned after the GEM
IPM calculation and be utilized by the FMT part on the next time
iteration. The &lt;TaskName&gt;-dat.lst file may contain any number of
(comma-separated) DBR file names. These files will be read
one-by-one: (a) into the same work DATABR structure on the level of
TNode class for coupling of GEMIPM with already existing FMT codes;
(b) distributed into different DATABR structures for many nodes on the
level of TNodeArray class&nbsp; (and coupled FMT-GEM codes written on
the
basis of TNodeArray); see documentation to the TNodeArray example for
more information in this respect.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
As an option, the DCH and DBR files can be read in in the binary
format (after changing the second -t key to -b in the file
&lt;TaskName&gt;-dat.lst. <br>
  <br>
The DBR text input file consists of several logical sections.
Dimesions of
all arrays in DATABR correspond to those given in Section 2 of DCH
file, and the order of
components and phases - to the index lists in Section (4) in the
DCH
file.
Here, we will refer to tags from these
two sections even though these tags are not present in the DBR file;
it is assumed&nbsp; that the DATACH structure exists and is correctly
filled out before any operation with DBR files or DATABR structures. <br>
  <br>
  <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">The DBR text input file consists
of six&nbsp; sections, of which&nbsp;
section (1) contains controls of the GEM IPM operation and data
exchange; section (2) contains chemical scalar variables; section (3)
FMT scalar variablesl; section (4) is independent component data
section;sections (5) is dependent component data section; and, finally,
section (7)
contains some&nbsp; data for phases.</span><br>
  <br>
There is no <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;END_DIM&gt;</span>
tag in the DBR file. Any other data object fields can appear in any
order, and some data objects can be skipped. If the data object tag is
not found in the input file, its elements will be assigned default
values, if possible. It is recommended to place the input data&nbsp; in
logical sections as printed from GEMS code.<br>

  </p>
  <p>The file consists of one or more input data objects (fields) and
optional comment lines. <br>
  </p>
  <p>A comment line begins with the '#' character in the first
position; by reading the file, anything after '#' will be ignored until
the line end code(s). <br>
  </p>
  <p>Any data object field begins with a tag - an identifier in angle
brackets &lt;&gt;. The tag is followed by one or more values, depending
on the type and dimensions of the respective data object. The values
are space-,
tab-, or endline -separated; the numerical values can be given as
(signed) integer, floating-point, or decimal exponent (with e or E)
forms; the string values must be taken in quotes ' ' or " ", e.g.
'Quartz'. <br>
An example of the data object with comment

  <p>So, in this example, the <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;bIC&gt;</span>
data object in the DBR file can be represented like this (the
second line is a comment for readability):: <br>
  </p>
  <p
 style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: monospace; color: rgb(204, 102, 0);"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;bIC&gt;&nbsp;</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">3.31e-04&nbsp; 3.31e-04&nbsp;
2.0e-07&nbsp; 110.6837&nbsp; 1.0e-07&nbsp; 55.34286&nbsp; 0 <br>
#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>'C'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; 'Ca'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Cl'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
'H'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mg'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
'O'&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Zz' <br>
  </p>
  <p><br>
&nbsp;After the <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;END_DIM&gt;</span>
tag (present in DCH and IPM files), other data object items may
follow in any order (although it is recommended to keep them in logical
sections as arranged in the files printed from the GEMS code). <br>
  </p>
  <p>Some data objects can be skipped (the tag together with all
values; part of values cannot be skipped). Many data object fields
after the <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;END_DIM&gt;</span>
tag in IPM and in the DBR file are not mandatory; when
skipped, the default values will be set in the program memory. However,
if some optional dimensions are set (e.g. <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;Lads&gt;</span> before the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;END_DIM&gt;</span> tag in the
IPM file) then the data objects connected to it must also be
provided in the rest of the file.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
  <p>The possibility to skip data objects with default values can make
the
input data files really compact. For instance, the amply commented data
input files <span style="font-family: monospace;"><a
 href="../txt/dch-dat-doc.txt">dch-dat-doc.txt</a>, <a
 href="../txt/ipm-dat-doc.txt">ipm-dat-doc.txt</a></span> and <a
 href="../txt/dbr-dat-doc.txt"><span style="font-family: monospace;">dbr-dat-doc.txt</span></a>
can be condensed as shown below: <br>

Please remember that&nbsp; the DCH and IPM files are read
only once per GEMIPM2K session, and any number of DBR files (for
nodes) can be provided and read in a sequence (for the whole node array
on the TNodeArray level).&nbsp; These DBR files normally have different
bulk
compositions (&lt;bIC&gt;) and&nbsp; &lt;NodeHandle&gt; values. If the
DCH file
contains lookup arrays for thermodynamic data, also &lt;T&gt; and

nDC rows and nIC columns. Each column corresponds to an Independent
Component (the order is given in the &lt;ICNL&gt; list); each row&nbsp;
- to a Dependent Component (the order is in the &lt;DCNL&gt; list).
Numbers in a row tell how many moles of each IC are contained in 1 mol
of a DC to which
this row belongs. In aquatic systems, the last column of this matrix
contains the formula charge for ion or complex.<br>

  <p>More comments for <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;NodeStatusCH&gt;</span>:
If GEMIPM calculation is called
when in the DATABR structure
this code is set to 1 then the simplex automatic initial approximation
will be used. This results in a larger number of GEM IPM iterations
(typically between 20 and 100) but guarantees that the correct stable
phase assemblage will be found. Alternatively, setting the code to 5
causes GEM IPM to use the available GEM solution (vectors 'xDC' and
'gam' in this file) as the initial approximation. This may dramatically
reduce the number of iterations (typically to 1 - 5) but does not
guarantee that the possible appearance of a new phase (e.g. upon change
of T or bulk composition) will be detected. The normal return codes for
both modes are, respectively, 2 and 6. It is advisable for the FMT
program part to check these codes in this field before continuing
because any other code value except 1,2 and 5,6 signals an error in GEM
calculation (see NODECODECH in DATABR.H for details). Please, note
that, if the return code 2 or 6 is left unchanged in the DATABR
structure and GEM calculation is called then nothing will be done and
the control will be returned with the code unchanged. A brief list of
NodeStatuCH codes is given below.<br>
