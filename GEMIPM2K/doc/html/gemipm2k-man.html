<h2>Standalone GEM-IPM-2 Solver of Chemical Equilibria by Gibbs Energy
Minimization<br>

<h3>Summary<br>
</h3>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align: left;">The
GEMIPM2K code is a numerical kernel module
extracted from the GEM-Selektor code package for Gibbs energy
minimization (GEM) and enhanced with RAM-
and file-system- data exchange interfaces without GUI. GEM
is a method of chemical thermodynamic modeling with emphasis on complex
heterogeneous
equilibria involving phases-solutions and sorption. GEMIPM2K is
designed for
coupling GEM chemical solver with
existing and new fluid-mass-transport (FMT)
codes. The program source code is compatible with ANSI
C++ and can be compiled on many computer platforms (Windows, Linux, HPC
Merlin, Cray XT, etc.) using several optimizing
compilers (GNU C++, PGI C++, Intel
C++, Microsoft C++, &#8230; ). The input data can be provided in ASCII files
(also produced from GEM-Selektor), the
output can also be written in ASCII files. Alternatively, the whole
data
exchange with a transport code part can be performed in RAM
using DATACH
and DATABR data structures.
This data exchange interface is implemented in two C++ classes &#8211; TNode
and TNodeArray. The TNode class provides functionality for attaching
GEMIPM2K
kernel to an existing transport model code which keeps the chemical
information
for all nodes and calls GEM
calculation for each node separately. The TNodeArray class is built on
top of the TNode class and can store both chemical and dynamic data
for all nodes of the mass transport problem; the re-calculation of
equilibrium
states after the mass transport step can be done with a single call
(with
internal parallelization possible); this may be suitable for developing
of a
new transport code. Both GEMIPM2K and GEM-Selektor codes are developed
jointly at the Paul Scherrer Institute (NES LES) and at ETH Zurich
(ERDW IGMR). In perspective, the GEMIPM2K code will be distributed
under
LGPL or similar license.<br>

<h2><a name="TAG_INTRO"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: left; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Modern
approaches to reactive mass transport (RMT) or fluid mass transport
(FMT) modelling require simultaneous account for the mass transport of
contaminants through aqueous and/or gas phase in subsurface, together
with their
interaction with wall-rock minerals by means of (ad)sorption,
mineral (co)precipitation, dissolution, etc.&nbsp; These chemical
processes are inherently
complex; they depend on the redox state of the system, and may involve
many phases and chemical species, some of which are
kinetically dependent. Such interactions may adversely affect the mass
transport
via the porosity and permeability changes e.g. due to mineral
dissolution or
precipitation. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Direct
inclusion of all possible chemical reactions in the mass transport
model is possible (e.g.[<a href="gemipm2k-man.html#Ref_Steefel_2009">Steefel
and Maher
2009</a>]), but may render it intractable in 2D or 3D space.
If this is the case, the chemical model must be dramatically simplified
to a
few reactions, which makes its chemical plausibility doubtful. The
modeller must make (often arbitrary) decisions about which chemical
interactions are relevant, and which ones can be neglected. <br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">An
alternative "operator-splitting" approach would be to keep a complex
enough chemical model
in a kind of "black box" which can be applied separately to each
node of the FMT model at each given time point <span
 style="font-style: italic;">t</span>.&nbsp; The&nbsp; input of
the "chemical black box" at time <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span>&nbsp;
is just the vector of bulk chemical composition <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b</span>
of the reactive part of the node, as well as temperature <span
 style="font-style: italic;">T</span>, pressure <span
 style="font-style: italic;">P</span>, and optionally, kinetic
constraints <span style="font-style: italic;">k</span> on some
reactions or amounts of certain components. Some or all of these inputs
could have been changed by the mass transport part on its previous
iteration time step <span style="font-style: italic;">t-</span>1.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
"chemical black box" equilibration is then applied
to each node independently at time point <span
 style="font-style: italic;">t</span>,
to produce changed speciation <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>
(amounts of chemical species in all reactive
phases),&nbsp; new phase volumes, redox state (expressed in values of
Eh, pe of aqueous solution,
gas fugacities, etc.), chemical potentials of components, and so on.
This
procedure can also detect a disappearance of some phases or
appearance of some new phases in some nodes (e.g., due to dissolution
or
precipitation of solids). <br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">After the
"chemistry" run over all nodes is
finished, the next time step of the FMT algorithm can be done for the
time point <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span>+1, using the
updated concentrations of mobile species in
aqueous
and/or gas phases at time <span style="font-style: italic;">t.</span>
The FMT part redistributes the matter between nodes (subject to mass
concervation), thus producing corrected compositions of reactive part
of
each node. So, the coupled RMT algorithm actually runs over all nodes
twice at the time point <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span>:&nbsp;
once doing a mass transport iteration using node compositions obtained
earlier (at <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span>-1), and
then&nbsp; by applying the "chemical black box" to each node at time <span
 style="font-style: italic;">t</span>, producing the updated speciation
which will be used by the FMT part at the next time point&nbsp; <span
 style="font-style: italic;">t</span>+1.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This
idea of "operator-splitting" coupling is not really new and it has
already been implemented in a number of
coupled codes (PHREEQC, GeoSys/RockFlow, MCOTAC, ....). These codes
use different mass transport algorithms, but in most cases the same
type of chemical
solver based on the law of mass action (LMA) and the Newton-Raphson
method
for minimizing the mass balance deviations. However, another type of
chemical solvers based on Gibbs energy minimization (GEM) can also
be&nbsp;
coupled with the FMT codes. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Both LMA and
GEM can solve the so-called&nbsp; forward
chemical modeling problem, which consists in finding the
concentrations (or
amounts) and activities of chemical species in aqueous and other phases
present
in a complex chemical system in an equilibrium state defined by
temperature <span style="font-style: italic;">T</span>, pressure <span
 style="font-style: italic;">P</span>, and the
system bulk composition <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>. In
practice, calculations for
solving such problems range from trivial to complex,
depending on
the number of species, phases, and stoichiometry units. The complexity
further
increases when several phases-solutions with redox sensitive components
are
included in the mass balance; a typical case is the aqueous - solid
solution (Aq-SS) system which also involves a non-ideal fluid (gas
mixture) phase. Even more complex systems can be considered, e.g. those
involving (ad)sorption on several co-existing
sorbents. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Chemical
speciation problems were traditionally solved with help of the LMA
codes,
supported with tools for calculation of
Lippmann functions and saturation indexes. A good introduction
into modern LMA chemical speciation numerical
methods can be found in several textbooks [<a
 href="gemipm2k-man.html#Ref_Van-Zeggeren-1970">Van Zeggeren and
Storey,
1970</a>; <a href="gemipm2k-man.html#Ref_Morel-Hering-1993">Morel and
Hering, 1993</a>; <a href="gemipm2k-man.html#Ref_Bethke-1996">Bethke,
1996</a>] and in the manuals of
speciation codes such as PHREEQC [<a
 href="gemipm2k-man.html#Ref_Parkhurst-Appelo-1999">Parkhurst
and Appelo, 1999</a>] or CHESS
[<a href="gemipm2k-man.html#Ref_van-der-Lee-1998">van der Lee, 1998</a>].
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
advantages of LMA - excellent mass balance accuracy and fast
convergence - are best revealed in the case of simple aqueous
speciation models with known stable pure solid phase assemblage and
known Eh and fugacities of gases. The LMA codes require thermodynamic
data only for the product species (usually aqueous/surface complexes,
minerals, and gases), but not for the master species (usually aqueous
ions) - this "input data economy" can also be viewed as an advantage in
some cases.<br>
<br>
<a name="CRITIQUE-LMA"></a>However,
solving with LMA codes the complex equilibria that involve aqueous
electrolyte, many possible condensed phases (including solid
solutions or fluids) is,
in general, an inefficient process. Different approaches
to this problem are used in LMA chemical solvers. In the Geochemists
Workbench [<a href="gemipm2k-man.html#Ref_Bethke-1996">Bethke,1996</a>],&nbsp;
any pure
mineral phase
is taken as master species. Because there is no way to mix master
species, this program cannot handle solid solutions or gas mixtures at
all. Other LMA codes (such as PHREEQC) consider minerals and gases as
product species. As pointed by [<a
 href="gemipm2k-man.html#Ref_Reed-1982">Reed, 1982</a>],
usually no solids are taken into mass balance in the initial speciation
calculation; after it is done, the saturation indexes are computed for
each stoichiometrically feasible mineral phase, the mineral with the
highest oversaturation is included into the mass balance, the
speciation is computed again, and this loop is repeated until no
supersaturated phases are left in the list. <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The real
problem
in LMA approach is how to determine the saturation index of the solid
solution
phase or of the gas mixture. For the ideal (solid) solution, this can
be
done over iterations using ionic activities
available from aqueous speciation. For non-ideal SS, this is a problem
which has
no general solution, as explained on Page 94 in [</span><a
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"
 href="gemipm2k-man.html#Ref_Bruno_ea_2007">Bruno et al, 2007</a><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">]. Because of that,
the
LMA chemical solvers can at best treat only ideal solution phases and
simple binary non-ideal solid solutions that can be described using
Lippmann functions and diagrams. If many solids and/or solid solutions
are potentially present,&nbsp; a simple LMA aqueous
speciation calculation turns into a series of many runs controlled by
non-rigorous
test procedures for selecting (over)saturated solids one-by-one,
without a theoretical guarantee of
convergence to a unique result. This kind of retardation is difficult
to evaluate, but, with a large list of possible condensed phases, more
than ten LMA loops may be required to include all stable solids
into
mass balance.</span> </p>
<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: left; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A
complementary GEM (Gibbs Energy Minimization) method of
thermodynamic modeling has been implemented in several computer codes
such as
ChemSage/ FactSage ({Eriksson, 1989 #6176; Eriksson, 1990 #3835};
http://www.factsage.com
{Bale, 2009 #7370}); Gibbs/HCh ({Borisov, 1992 #6207},
http://www.ga.gov.au/rural/projects/HCh.jsp);
Selektor-C {Karpov, 2001 #4848}; and GEM-Selektor ([<a
 href="gemipm2k-man.html#Ref_Kulik-ea-2004">Kulik et al., 2004</a>];
http://gems.web.psi.ch). GEM
algorithms can solve complex chemical equilibria in a straightforward
way. The
applicability of GEM is limited
only by the knowledge of standard-state molar properties of end-members
and the
non-ideal interaction parameters of mixing in each multi-component
phase. In the
following description, mainly the convex
programming approach to GEM will
be considered [<a href="gemipm2k-man.html#Ref_Karpov-ea-1997">Karpov et
al., 1997</a>; <a href="gemipm2k-man.html#Ref_Karpov-ea-2001">2001</a>],
as implemented in GEMIPM2K
and GEM-Selektor v.2&#8211;PSI code [<a
 href="gemipm2k-man.html#Ref_Kulik-ea-2004">Kulik et al., 2004</a>] and
distributed with a built-in Nagra/PSI chemical thermodynamic data base
{Hummel, 2002 #4830; Hummel, 2002 #6981}. <br>
</p>
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: left; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
GEM method computes simultaneously the primal (amounts of dependent
components
and their activity coefficients) and the dual
(chemical potentials of independent components) solutions. From the
latter, other
thermodynamic quantities (activities, concentrations, pH, pe) and
criteria of
equilibrium are obtained. If non-ideal phases are included then the
activity
coefficients of their components are adjusted on each GEM
iteration and come out as part of the primal solution.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: left; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In
comparison
with chemical models based on the law of mass action (LMA, such as
PHREEQC or
MINEQL) so far mainly used in coupled FMT-chemistry
codes, GEM has advantage that it
can handle any number of potentially possible phases, including any
number of
(highly) non-ideal solutions, which slow down the convergence only
moderately
(see details in <a href="gemipm2k-man.html#Ref_Bruno_ea_2007">[Bruno
et al., 2007</a>], p.90-104).
From bulk chemical composition, temperature and pressure, GEM
calculates amounts and activities of all
components in all stable phases, plus any activity-derived quantities
such as
gas fugacity, pH and Eh. Volumes of all phases present in the (node)
reactive
system can be found when the standard molar volumes for their
components are provided
in thermodynamic database. The disadvantages of GEM
in comparison to LMA codes are much slower convergence and generally
worse mass
balance precision. The latter can be greatly improved at cost of a few
additional
iterations and internally consistent thermodynamic data [<a
 href="gemipm2k-man.html#Ref_TM-44-02-06">Chudnenko ea,
2002</a>]. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
present GEMIPM2K code is a GEM-Selektor
kernel chemical
solver equipped with a data exchange interface that makes it possible
to
couple any existing FMT code with the GEM&nbsp; "chemical black box" to
produce a coupled modeling code with high chemical plausibility. As
there is no GUI and data exchange occurs via files or directly in
computer RAM, such code
can be parallelized and compiled on various platforms up to HPC
clusters.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The traditional
"operator-splitting" coupling, where the chemical information for all
nodes is
stored in the mass transport part which calls the chemical solver for
each node one-by-one, is
supported by the TNode C++ class. When a
new FMT code is written, the whole data storage for all nodes can also
be
organized (using a TNodeArray C++ class) into node arrays, with each
node accessible
from the GEM IPM-2 routines or from the FMT program. </p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This
document describes the structure of GEMIPM2K program and the data
exchange interface (DATACH and DATABR structures), followed by an
overview of TNode and TNodeArray classes and examples of their
usage (see also another document&nbsp; <a

<h3><a name="TAG-IPM2-ALGORITHM"></a>2.2. The GEM IPM-2 algorithm
(brief overview) </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The GEM IPM2
algorithm is described in more detail in a companion PSI Technical
Report [<a href="#Ref_Kulik_ea-2008">Kulik et
al., 2009</a>] , as well as in earlier report [<a
 href="#Ref_TM-44-02-06">Chudnenko et al., 2002</a>]. A short overview
is given in [<a href="#Ref_Bruno_ea_2007">Bruno et al., 2007</a>],
pages 94-104. Recently, the speed of GEM IPM-2 calculations has been
dramatically increased [<a href="#Ref_Dmytrieva-2008">Dmytrieva et al.,
2009</a>] and now is comparable with that of LMA codes, at least in
"smart initial approximation" mode. <br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The basic idea of
the GEM IPM algorithm consists in finding such a distribution vector <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n </span>of bulk chemical composition of
the system <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span> over its
thermodynamic phases and their components that the total Gibbs energy <span
 style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>)
of the system is at minimum at temperature and pressure of interest.
Each phase component (chemical species) is represented by its
stoichiometry and the standard chemical potential (molar Gibbs energy
function <span style="font-style: italic;">g</span><sup>o</sup>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">T,P</span>)) at temperature <span
 style="font-style: italic;">T</span> and pressure <span
 style="font-style: italic;">P</span> of interest. As seen on Fig. 2-1,
the process consists of four major steps. <br>

Simplified flowchart of GEM IPM algorithm<br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
<a name="INITIAL_APPROXIMATION"></a>The first step is to obtain an
initial approximation of the <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>
vector which is close enough to
the <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span>) minimum, so that the GEM process
would succeed in finding the solution of the problem. In principle, any
previously calculated speciation vector<span style="font-style: italic;">
n</span> for this setup of thermodynamic system (even for different <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b, T, P</span>) can be used as initial
approximation in "smart initial approximation" (SIA) mode. If no
previous solution is available at all, or the available one is bad,
then the so-called "automatic initial approximation" (AIA) must
obtained by solving a linear programming (LP) sub-problem using a
modified simplex method. <br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The LP
sub-problem is constructed by truncating all the mixing terms from
chemical potential expressions for all components of phases-solutions,
which is equivalent to considering any component as a pure phase. Given
<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">N</span>) Independent Components (usually
chemical elements and charge) in the bulk composition vector <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, the simplex solution contains at
most <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">N</span>) non-zero elements in the AIA
speciation vector <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>(AIA).
This is also consistent with the Gibbs phase rule. <br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Usually, the
number of aqueous species is greater than <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>).
If the number of stoichiometrically possible phases exceeds n(N), such
system is called "multisystem" [Karpov et al., 1997]. Equilibria in
multisystems cannot be solved directly by LMA algorithm (see a <a
 href="#CRITIQUE-LMA">comment here</a>), but such equilibria can be
solved in one GEM run, if the initial approximation belongs to the
so-called "feasible domain". So, the second step consists in checking
whether the AIA or SIA vector <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>
is feasible, i.e. whether the mass balance residuals for all
independent components are small enough. This is usually so in the case
of previously available SIA vector. But the AIA vector contains many
zero amounts of chemical species (dependent components) which may be
relevant aqueous species or form stable condensed or fluid phases,
although this is not a priori known. For that reason, the zero mole
amounts in the AIA initial approximation are filled out with a default
amount (1e-7 - 1e-6 mol) which then would increase or decrease upon GEM
iterations depending on the stability of the chemical species in this
chemical system. If the current amount of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">j</span>-th species <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n<sub>j</sub></span> falls below a certain
numerical threshold (ca. 1e-20 mol), it will be zeroed off. This
eliminates the <span style="font-style: italic;">j</span>-th species
from subsequent GEM iterations in order to avoid numerical troubles.
However, if the total amount of a phase falls below another threshold
(Pa_DS between 1e-9 and 1e-12 mol) then all components in this phase
will be zeroed off and the whole phase is eliminated from next GEM
iterations.<br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The fill-out
procedure in AIA bears also a danger that the mass balance is violated.
Hence, a special EFD() algorithm checks the mass balance residuals and
tries to change the largest elements of the AIA vector in such a way
that the mass balance accuracy would be at least satisfactory (i.e.
deviations less than 1e-7 mol). This is usually done in a few
iterations, and then the initial approximation vector is ready for the
main GEM algorithm. <br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><a
 name="EFD_PROCEDURE"></a>The third step is
to adjust the elements of <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>speciation
vector <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> to minimize the
total Gibbs energy of the system <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span>) while keeping mass balance
deviations the same or lower as inherited from the EFD() step. This is
the core of IPM-2 algorithm - it approaches the GEM problem using the
duality (Kuhn-Tucker) theorem by introducing Lagrange multipliers <span
 style="font-style: italic;">u<sub>i</sub></span> conjugate to the
elements <span style="font-style: italic;">b<sub>i</sub></span> of the
bulk composition vector. These Lagrange multipliers form the so-called
"dual solution" of the GEM problem (the "primal solution" being the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span> speciation vector). The total
Gibbs energy of the system can be calculated either as <span
 style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>)
= sum(<span style="font-style: italic;">n<sub>j</sub> v<sub>j</sub></span>)
where <span style="font-style: italic;">v<sub>j</sub></span> = <span
 style="font-style: italic;">f</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">g</span><sup>o</sup><sub><span
 style="font-style: italic;">j</span></sub>, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span>) is the primal chemical potential
of j-th dependent component., or as <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) = sum(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">b<sub>i</sub> u<sub>i</sub></span>).
Towards equilibrium, <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span>) scalar value approaches a
(global) minimum which equals the <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) (global) maximum. Hence, the
criterion of convergence can be constructed using any normalized
function of <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span>) - <span
 style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)
which is ideally zero, but numerically must be below a small threshold
(for the quadratic Dikin's criterion, DK &lt; Pa_DK = 1e-4).&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Each iteration of
IPM consists of three steps. First, a new dual solution approximation <span
 style="font-style: italic;">u</span> is found by solving with the
Cholesky decomposition method a SLE constructed from the previous
primal solution, stoichiometry matrix and weight multipliers. Next, the
vector of descent direction is found by comparing primal and dual
chemical potentials for each dependent component. Finally, a step
length multiplier is determined from a condition that no new nj value
should break the "feasible domain" of mass balance and metastability
constraints. The new approximation of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span> speciation vector is found by
incrementing non-zero elements of the old one with a product of the
respective element of the descent direction vector and the scalar step
length. Convergence is usually achieved in 1-10 iterations in the SIA
and 20 to 100 iterations in the simplex AIA case. <br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The fourth step
is called "phase selection" (implemented in PhaseSelect() function). It
consists in calculation of Karpov's phase stability criteria for each
multi-component phase present in non-zero amount, as well as for each
pure phase, either zeroed off or not. The stability criteria have been
derived from the Karpov-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of equilibrium state
that compare primal and dual estimates of chemical potential for each
component. For any stable component in a stable phase, the value of
such criterion must be close to zero.&nbsp; However, if the initial
approximation was bad, or there were errors in stoichiometry or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">g</span><sup>o</sup> value for a dependent
component, <span style="font-style: italic;"></span> the value of
Karpov's criterion may indicate that a phase present in the mass
balance is unstable and must be excluded, or vice versa - a phase
absent from the mass balance (zeroed off) is stable and must be
included. If any such phase has been detected, it is zeroed off
respectively its component amounts are filled out with small amounts,
and the whole sequence is repeated from Step two (but without the
overall fill-out step). If, after three such refinement loops, the
PhaseSelect() still finds inconsistent phases, the behavior of GEM IPM
algorithm depends on the original initial approximation. If it was SIA,
the mode is automatically switched to AIA and calculation begin "from
scratch", i.e. from solving the LP sub-problem for a generic IA. If it
was AIA, an error message is generated and the GEM solution is not
accepted. <br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The flow-chart
described above applies when all elements of the bulk composition
vector (except charge) exceed 1e-6 mol. However, if there are some
elements less than 1e-7 mol, the IPM algorithm starting with AIA may
fail with the corresponding mass balance residual which may also be of
the same order of magnitude or even higher (i.e. the mass balance error
may be from 50% to 1000%). The reason for that is the "fill-out" step
spoils the mass balance and the EFD() procedure cannot recover it
completely. In this sutiation, the IPM-2 algorithm is invoked, which in
the case of AIA first runs as the generic IPM algorithm. Even with bad
mass balance precision, this step yields a solution which lies very
close to the <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span>) minimum and can be used as a
very good initial approximation where the fill-out procedure is not
needed (because all stable phases and components are already known) and
the mass balance residuals thresholds in the EFD-2() procedure can be
set at much lower levels, separately for different independent
components. This is the idea of IPM-2 refinement loops: after
convergence of GEM descent and PhaseSelect() check, an additional check
for the fullfillment of severe mass balance requirements is performed.
If there are still some bad residuals, the loop is repeated with just
obtained approximation of the <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>
vector from the EFD-2() procedure. In most cases, up to 15 such loops
are sufficient to provide a GEM solution with 0.1% maximum mass balance
residual even for the smallest "trace" independent component present in
1e-14 mol total amount. <br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A similar
sequence of refinement loops can be applied when two or more non-ideal
solution phases are present near the critical point of their solvus. In
such a system, the difference in molar Gibbs energy of such phases
becomes tiny and up to 20 refinement GEM-IPM2 runs may be required to
obtain correct speciation. Such systems, however, are rare and in
principle cannot be solved with LMA algorithms. <br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">All these
numerical paths of the iterative GEM IPM-2 algorithm are controlled
through ca. 20 thresholds and flags, values of which were empirically
found in many test and modelling calculations in various systems. These
<a href="#NUMERICAL_CONTROLS">numerical controls</a> can be adjusted
in GEMS-PSI GUI window or in the <big><span

<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: left; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Algorithms
described in the previous section &#8211; the GEMIPM2 kernel - are
implemented in the
TMulti class (see ms_multi.h file). This C++ class includes the main
work
structure called MULTI, as well as a number of supplementary data
structures
and functions. Before starting the GEM IPM calculation, all input data
arrays
in the MULTI work instance must be filled out. </p>
<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></div>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: left; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In
the GEM-Selektor
package, most of this data is taken from the work instance of TSyst
class
(SYSTEM data structure) and from the work instance of TMTparm class
(MTPARM
data structure), both connected to the RMULTS data structure containing
lists
of components and phases included into a GEMS modeling project. These
data are
98% accessible through the GEMS GUI windows. Upon collecting the
information
into the MULTI structure, the data for all components and phases that
have been
switched off will be skipped. </p>
<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></div>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: left; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In
the GEMIPM2K
code, no GUI is available; the only way to exchange input and output
data with
GEM IPM kernel (work instance of the MULTI data
structure) is through TNode class functions
that use DATACH and DATABR
structures. One way is to read the DCH, IPM and DBR input files of
GEMIPM2K;
another way (used in coupled reactive transport codes) is to exchange
data directly
in computer memory (see GEMIPM2K_User_Reference.html
documentation file; see also Appendix 1 in this report). </p>
<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></div>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: left; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
format
and content of GEMIPM2K input/output files are described in the
gemipm2k-inp.html documentation file. In the text
variant, these files can be typed by the user with help of a simple
ASCII text
editor. However, it is highly recommended to produce them using the
GEM-Selektor code which can save a lot of work time, especially when
coupled
modeling must be performed at temperatures and pressures varying from
node to
node or with time. This is more than just technical issue: it is
essential to
investigate the behavior and stiffness of the chemical system in detail
(by
performing GEMS runs up to the simulation of irreversible mixing,
oxidation/reduction, or titration) before inserting it into the coupled
reactive transport model, calculation of which is far more expensive.
Making
the DCH, IPM and DBR files in GEM-Selektor is quite easy, as outlined
in the
next section.<br>

<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: left; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It
is
possible to produce a set of DCH, IPM and DBR files readable by
GEMIPM2K for
any single chemical system that has been set up and calculated in
GEM-Selektor at
least once. Refer to GEMS documentation and online screenshot tutorial
(http://gems.web.psi.ch) for learning how to make a GEMS modeling
project and
set up the chemical system of your interest. </p>
<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></div>
<p class="MsoNormal"

this is
done, go into &#8220;Single Thermodynamic System&#8221; dialog (accessible in
&#8220;Computation
of Equilibria&#8221; mode), read the needed SysEq record, and re-calculate
the
equilibrium (press Accept when done). Now use the menu command &#8220;Data&#8221;

tolerances. In
the simplest case (constant T,P)
leave all this unchanged. When ready, click &#8220;Next&#8221;, then give the name

<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<p>In the above-mentioned &#8220;Setup &#8230; &#8221; dialog, you can also

<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-bottom: 6pt; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align: left;">The
GEM IPM2 algorithm described in Section II is
implemented in a TMulti C++ class. This class and related
source code files are shared between the GEM-Selektor
(GEMS-PSI)
package (with GUI, database management system, script interpreter and
runtime
help system) and a standalone solver GEMIPM2K. The difference between
two programs is
controlled by a compiler define key&nbsp; -DGEMIPMPLUGIN&nbsp; which
has to be provided in the make- or
project file for building any program that uses GEMIPM2K. The
global&nbsp; #define
GEMIPMPLUGIN&nbsp; in the source code cuts any connection to
the GEM-Selektor GUI, its data object descriptors, and data base
functions. This
is done because the main idea behind GEMIPM2K is
to provide a GEM chemical solver
which is easy to couple with existing fluid-mass-transport codes in the
&#8220;operator-splitting&#8221;
fashion, as well as to compile and launch them on high-performance
computers.&nbsp; </p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-bottom: 6pt; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align: left;">Because
GEMIPM2K implemented as a &#8220;node-gem&#8221; example has no overhead on calling
GUI or
database functions, it provides a good opportunity to test performance
of GEM IPM2 module in terms of calculation times, as
well as to locate parts of the code where most of the time is spent (in
IT
jargon, this procedure is called &#8220;profiling&#8221;).&nbsp;
</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-bottom: 6pt; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align: left;">The
GEMIPM2K
is a program package (available as a standalone variant from the
authors) arranged
in three C++ classes: TMulti, TNode and TNodeArray. </p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-bottom: 6pt; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align: left;">The
TMulti class is based on the MULTI
data structure combined with all subroutines where the IPM-2 algorithm
is implemented. TMulti class also
contains many built-in functions for calculation of DC activity
coefficients in
aqueous, fluid/gas, solid and liquid solutions, and sorption phases, as
well as
a connection to GEMS script
interpreter (the latter is disabled in GEMIPM2K). One practically
important
part is a collection of numerical controls that define the convergence
and
accuracy of GEM IPM2 algorithm. Description of these controls is
provided in gems_ipm.html file; they all can be set also in the
IPM input file of GEMIPM2K, as described in gemipm2k-inp.html
file. The work data structure MULTI of the TMulti class contains
parameters and coefficients of
built-in non-ideal mixing models in phases-solutions, all implemented
in the TSolMod class (documentation about input parameters
is given in g_tsolmod.html file). </p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-bottom: 6pt; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align: left;">The
TNode class provides a simple non-GUI interface for
loading the input chemical system definition and related thermodynamic
and
composition data into the IPM (MULTI) work structure,
then running the IPM2 algorithm for one calculation of equilibrium
state, and
extracting calculated speciation into the DATABR structure
(or DBR file). Description of TNode functions is provided in
GEMIPM2K_User_Reference.html
file.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-bottom: 6pt; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align: left;">The
TNodeArray class, built on top of the TNode class, can store both
chemical and transport
parameters for all nodes of the mass transport problem. Re-calculation
of
equilibrium states after the mass transport step can be done with a
single call
(with internal parallelization possible). This may be suitable for
developing a

<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">TNode class uses
two data interface structures &#8211; DATACH and DATABR (defined in datach.h
and databr.h headers, respectively). The structures can be
allocated in computer RAM (one instance of DATACH
and one or more instances of DATABR) and written to or read from text
or binary files (DCH and DBR format, respectively). In addition, the
IPM-2
specific data and arrays used by built-in functions for non-ideal
mixing models
can be read from the IPM format file directly into the MULTI structure.
As the TNode
class is also part of the GEM-Selektor package, all three files can be
produced
per mouse click from there and then used in standalone coupled code
calculations
(see Section 2.4).</p>

The GEM
IPM-2 algorithm is implemented as a set of C++ functions belonging to
the TMulti class that all use data and lists provided in a single
instance of the&nbsp; MULTI data structure also inserted into the
TMulti class. Before any GEM calculation, all data arrays must be
allocated according to current number of components and phases, and all
input data must be correctly filled into these arrays. <br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In the
GEMS-PSI GUI environment, this is done automatically before any GEM
calculation is started. The data of the "internal" GEM problem are
compressed into MULTI data structure by collecting the items from the
project system lists and arrays, as well as from the thermodynamic data
base. In the project system lists, many independent components,
dependent components, and phases may be switched off by the user. Only
the names and data for components and phases that are switched on are
copied into the MULTI structure. If necessary, the scripts for
calculating activity coefficients of components of non-ideal solution
phases are also compressed, together with any needed coefficients for
non-ideal interaction parameters or surface complexation models picked
up from the Phase database records. This makes the GEMS GUI setup of
thermodynamic models very flexible, though rendering its software
implementation rather complicated. <br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This route
cannot be followed in the standalone GEMIPM2K program and any programs
using it. The purpose of GEMIPM2K development was to keep the code
implementation
and handling of I/O data as simple as possible. This is the
prerequisite for compiling the cupled FMT-GEM program on any computer
architecture, up to parallel HPC clusters. Consequently, the GEMIPM2K
program has no GUI, no direct access to thermodynamic data base, and it
has no script interpreter included. It uses only data for a
"compressed" GEM problem thoroughly contained in the MULTI structure
(i.e. no components or phases that were switched off from the lists are
allowed). Because of that, some restrictions apply in GEMIPM2K relative
to GEMS-PSI code: <br>

All the input data required for GEM IPM-2
calculation can be provided in a human-made ASCII file. However,
producing such a file without software front-end that can access the
thermodynamic data base would be a difficult and error-prone
process. <br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Moreover,
RMT problems are usually represented by many nodes; reactive subsystems
in all these nodes can share the same chemical system definition (CSD)
and would usually differ only in bulk chemical composition (,
temperature and pressure). Hence, it would make no sense to use the
MULTI data structure directly for data exchange with the mass-transport
part. Often, not all independent and dependent components must take
place in exchange with the MT part - only those components that are
somehow transported from node to node. <br>

reasons, the whole content of the MULTI and BASE_PARAM data structures

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
advantage of having three kinds of input files instead of one is that
in a typical RMT problem with tens to hundreds of thousands of nodes,
only one
relatively large DCH and one IPM file is needed, while node-specific
data are provided in many small and compact input-output DBR files
without redundant information. As a consequence,&nbsp; higher
performance and flexibility of the coupled code can be achieved. <br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In the
current implementation of GEMIPM2K, two file I/O modes are possible:
binary stream and text stream. Binary stream DCH, DBR and IPM files are
simply images of the respective memory data structures; they may be
non-transferable between different computer architectures. The text
stream files are transferable; they have a human-readable format with
tags (keywords) followed with the data; comment lines are possible
almost anywhere. For most data items, the input order is free; many
data
objects can be
skipped if the program can substitute default values.&nbsp; Only&nbsp;
dimenions necessary for internal data allocation must be present at the
beginning of DCH and IPM files. More about the file structure of
GEMIPM2K is provided in the <a href="gemipm2k-inp.html">companion

thermodynamic data
for dependent components is implemented through the Lagrange
interpolation from
look-up arrays provided in the DATACH structure and DCH file. These
lookup
arrays are generated in in GEM-Selektor package and written into the
DCH
file. To use the lookup arrays, the TNode class employs a 2-D Lagrange
interpolation routine
that extracts thermodynamic data for temperature and pressure of
interest and
loads them into the MULTI structure before starting the IPM-2
calculation. In
this way, the coupled models where temperature and/or pressure change
over time

<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">roW,epsW</span></big>&nbsp; and <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">visW</span></big> lookup arrays must
be provided because they are used internally in TSolMod functions for
calculation of activity coefficients of aqueous species and water. The <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">TNode</span></big> class provides
direct methods for accessing interpolated thermodynamic data from the
mass-transport part at any time (see <a
 href="GEMIPM2K%20User%20Reference.html">User's Reference</a>). <br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The trivial case
of lookup is when <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">nTp</span></big>
= 1 and <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">nPp</span></big> =
1. In this case, each thermodynamic data lookup array (see
the table above) must contain one
value per DC for a single temperature <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">TCval[0]</span></big> and pressure <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Pval[0]</span></big>. Conversely, no
variations in <span style="font-style: italic;">T,P</span> between the
nodes or with
time will then be allowed in the coupled model. Actually, the program
checks that current <span style="font-style: italic;">T</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">P</span> coincide with a value from <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">TCval </span></big>resp. <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Pval</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"></span></big> within the tolerance
limits given in <big><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Ttol</span></big> and <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Ptol</span></big>, respectively, and
picks up the values from grid arrays.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The more common
case is when the pressure is fixed (<big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">nPp</span></big> =
1) but the temperature in the nodes is allowed to change (e.g. <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">nTp</span></big>=
8). Then the <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">Pval</span></big>
array must contain a single value of pressure (e.g.
1 MPa) and the <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">Tval</span></big>
array must contain 8 values of temperature in ascending order
(e.g. 5, 25, 45, 65, 85, 105, 125, 145 <sup>o</sup>C). These values
define the overall temperature interval
{4.9; 145.1 <sup>o</sup>C}. The differences between adjacent
temperature values
must not
necessarily be equal. According to this setup, the <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">roW</span></big> and similar arrays
must contain 8 values each that correspond to 1 MPa pressure and the
temperatures given in <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">Tval</span></big>
array. Provided that there are 40 dependent
components in the DCH list, the <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">G0</span></big> array will consist of
8 values per
DC, i.e. total 320 numbers, the first 8 contain <span
 style="font-style: italic;">G</span><sup>o</sup> values for the first
species (for temperatures in <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">Tval</span></big>),
next 8 values - for the second
species, and so on. The <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">V0</span></big>
and other arrays should be organized likewise. The
interpolation subroutine looks then separately for each dependent
component to return <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span><sup>o</sup>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">V</span><sup>o</sup> values for <span
 style="font-style: italic;">P</span>=10 bar and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">T</span> of interest,
interpolated in 1-D mode, if necessary. <br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In the most
general
case, the lookup grid arrays contain numbers for several discrete
pressures and several discrete temperatures. Then the <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">roW</span></big> and <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">epsW</span></big>
arrays are actually&nbsp; tables made of rows each containing values
for different
temperatures from <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">Tval</span></big>
but one pressure value from <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">Pval</span></big>.
The <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">G0 </span></big>and <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">V0</span></big>
arrays are then composed of such tables for each dependent component,
arranged in the order in which the dependent components are listed in
the DATACH <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">DCNL</span></big>
list. The interpolation subroutine performs 2-D interpolation
separately for each dependent component to return its <span
 style="font-style: italic;">G</span><sup>o</sup> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">V</span><sup>o</sup> values
for <span style="font-style: italic;">P,T</span> of interest.&nbsp;
To achieve precise interpolation over a wide temperature interval (300
C or more), at least 30 temperature points and 10 pressure points are
recommended. <br>
</p>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Thus, the
lookup arrays of thermodynamic data permit GEMIPM2K to extract
thermodynamic
data for any current <span style="font-style: italic;">T</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">P</span> in any node, provided that <span
 style="font-style: italic;">T</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">P</span> are
within the respective ranges set in </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">TCval</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> and </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Pval</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> lists. </span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Before calling the
GEM IPM-2
calculation, </span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">the
interpolation is performed, and <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span><sup>o</sup>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">V</span><sup>o</sup> values are
loaded directly into the MULTI
structure, where they remain as long as the input <span
 style="font-style: italic;">P</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">T</span> do not
change. New
interpolation is done when the requested <span
 style="font-style: italic;">P</span> or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">T</span> differ from previous values by
more
than </span><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">Ptol</span></big><span

instance, the bulk chemical composition of the system - vector </span><span

is the

trivial. For instance, given 7 independent components in the system (</span><span

<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It is very important
to realize that the re-mapping does not affect any dimensions in the
MULTI structure and any DATACH lists and arrays (the latter remain
accessible in full also to the transport part of the coupled code).
Values for components and phases marked red (non-transported) are
skipped only from data arrays in all instances of the DATABR structure,
but
these components and phases are still present in DATACH and MULTI
structures and take part in the equilibration. In the above example,
the size of a DATABR instance (and DBR file) becomes more than 30% less
compared with the trivial (complete) index mapping case.&nbsp; This
decrease can be even more dramatic for some transport algorithms where
only a certain tracer moves, or where the advection strongly prevails
over the diffusion. In the latter case, only the bulk aqueous solution
is migrated as the whole between the nodes, so all dependent components
of the aqueous phase can be skipped from the DATABR mapping. In the
above example, this would make the DATABR instance ca. 3-4 times
smaller
than in the trivial mapping case. <br>
</span></span></big></p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It can be stated that
the presence of DATABR index mapping to DATACH structure provides a
great flexibility in defining various coupling schemes between the FMT
and the GEM parts. A natural question is - how the bulk composition of
the node system can be set up when the mapping list </span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">xIC</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> is incomplete?&nbsp;
A straightforward answer: the full&nbsp; </span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">b</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; vector can
always be
provided in the IPM file (from where it is directly loaded into the
MULTI structure). The </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">TNode</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> class also has
methods for the direct access to the </span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">b</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; vector using
the
DATACH/MULTI indexation, which can be used e.g. for setting in all
nodes the initial amounts of ICs skipped from the DATABR index mapping.
Use of this functionality makes sense in 2-D or 3-D FMT problems with
relatively large chemical system definition, where it may result in
considerably less memory demand and higher performance of data
exchange. However, the use of SIA initial approximation mode of GEM
IPM2 may be restricted in this case. Hence, for 1-D columns, we
recommend
using the trivial (complete) one-to-one mapping in DATABR and in DBR
files. </span></span></big></p>

<h3><a name="TAG_DATABR"></a>3.2. DATABR data exchange structure for
defining i/o data
for a single node system </h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This data
structure relies on dimensions provided in the DATACH structure. Hence,
the DCH file must always be read before DBR file(s) in order to
initialize the MULTI and DATABR structures and perform dynamic memory
allocation. <br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The DATABR
structure contains several flags and three blocks of data. In the
following tables, four columns are provided to indicate which data
fields are set in DATABR by the mass transport part (MT-DB); which are
given from DATABR instance to GEM as input data (DB-GEM); which data is
taken from GEM to DATABR as GEM output (GEM-DB); and which are taken
from DATABR instance to MT part data structures (DB-MT). The most
important GEM input and output data are shown in boldface. <br>

</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In the
AIA (automatic initial approximation)</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> mode, GEM
calculations are 100% reproducible but may rather slow (20 to 1000 IPM
iterations depending on the chemical system definition and
composition) because the simplex initial approximation is in general
not close to Gibbs energy minimum when phases solutions (especially
non-ideal) are present in the system. <br>
<br>
The alternative SIA </span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">(smart initial
approximation)</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> mode</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"></span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> uses the
currently available contents of the speciation (</span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">xDC</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">) and activity
coefficients (</span><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">gam</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">) vectors (perhaps
modified
through the DATABR interface after the mass transport step) as the
initial approximation. If the </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">xDC</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
vector for the current node does not violate the mass balance relative
to the current bulk
composition vector </span><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">bIC</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">, and neither the
phase assemblage nor the redox
state are going to change, then GEM is expected to do 0 to 10
iterations, i.e. 10-20 times faster than in the AIA mode. This
acceleration can be relevant for large
2-D or 3-D coupled FMT models. However, the SIA mode result is by
definition not exactly reproducible. Even repeated SIA mode
calculations for the same system always yield slightly different
amounts of dependent components because the previously computed
speciation taken as initial approximation is slightly different.
However, it is unlikely that this may lead to diverging coupled
modelling results because any GEM-calculated speciation must converge
to the Gibbs energy minimum. Nevertheless, the behavior of SIA mode GEM
calculation
relative to AIA in coupled models still needs more testing and
verification.<br>
</span>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The SIA
GEM calculation mode may be preferable over the AIA mode when the
mass transport part moves aqueous species. In this case, any changed
chemical speciation in the node is guaranteed to remain mass-balanced
because the corrections to the bulk composition vector </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">bIC</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> are
calculated from the corrections to </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">xDC</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
vector. The latter then is a good initial approximation at least in the
sense of mass balance, so the <a href="gemipm2k-man.html#EFD_PROCEDURE">GEM
EFD()
procedure</a> is not expected to do any extra iterations. <br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In meaningful
RMT problems, the phase association changes or redox
transitions occur
along some distinct reaction fronts or barriers that are represented by
only a small fraction of the nodes. In such a node, it may happen that
the
current speciation turns to be a bad GEM initial approximation. The GEM
IPM kernel has several built-in criteria to check if this happens
indeed; if so, then the program "smartly" switches to simplex (AIA)
initial approximation and obtains correct new phase assemblage and
speciation just at cost of performing more iterations. However,&nbsp;
for the vast majority of nodes that lie not in the vicinity of rock
heterogeneities or reaction fronts, slight changes of speciation and
composition upon the transport time iteration would not result in any
phase or redox transitions. In this case, the SIA approximation appears
safe
enough and GEM IPM is expected to converge in 1 to 10 iterations.<br>

several nodes can be arranged, where the chemical data and parameters
are kept
in dynamic arrays and exchanged with the GEMIPM2K in computer memory.
In this
example, no real mass transport is performed; its effect is just
simulated by a
loop that changes bulk compositions (</span><span

from one time
step to another. The modification to &#8220;real&#8221; mass transport method is
straightforward, although this would make the example program too
complicated.</span>&nbsp;<span style=""> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: left;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In some
mass-transport problems, the nodes may be very large (cubic metres) or
very
small (cubic millimetres), or may be very different in size. This may
render
the default numerical controls of GEM IPM-2 kernel inappropriate for
some node chemical
systems because the default controls (see </span><span
 style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">gems_ipm.html</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> file) refer to a
system of
about 1-2 kg total mass (total 100-200 moles) and may need adjustments
when the
current mass (or total number of moles) of the system is more than 10
times
different. The default maximum mole amount of any component in GEM
IPM-2 is 1<span style="">&times;</span>10</span><sup
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">6</sup><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
mol; this is another reason why the node system should not be too
large. In order
to eliminate potential troubles, an internal re-scaling mechanism was
built
into the TNode class implementation.</span> </p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: left;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This internal

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">GEM_run(InternalMass,uPrimalSol)</span>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">call. The

 style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">InternalMass</span>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">(in kg, default
1.0 kg) defines the mass to which the input bulk composition
(provided in the DATABR memory structure) will be scaled&nbsp;upon
loading it
into the IPM work structure MULTI. The related scaling factor is
automatically
calculated and stored in the TNode class instance. The GEM calculation
results
(extensive parameters such as the speciation vector, phase volumes,
total Gibbs
energy, etc.) are automatically back-scaled when they are copied from
MULTI
into DATABR structure; intensive parameters (chemical potentials,
activity
coefficients, concentrations of species in phases,
activities/fugacities, pH,
Eh, etc.) are not affected by re-scaling. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: left;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As the mass
transport part has no direct access to internal IPM work data, the
calculations
of equilibria occur as if they were done in &#8220;real&#8221; amounts consistent
with the
current size of the node. The reasonable range of the</span> <span
 style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">InternalMass</span>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">parameter is
from 0.01 to
100 kg. The use of internal re-scaling mechanism may lead, in general,
to a much
better convergence of GEMIPM2 and to higher accuracy of its results.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: left;"><span

<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">vector, amounts
of Dependent Components) is usually the output from GEM IPM
runs (can also be used as input initial approximation in SIA mode). The
ultimate
input of GEMIPM2K is the bulk chemical composition vector (</span><span
 style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">bIC</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">), temperature and
pressure. So, at time steps, the mass transport part should change the</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">bIC</span> <span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">vector and,
maybe, </span><i style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">T</i>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: left;"><span

existing advection/diffusion transport codes (e.g. GeoSys/
RockFlow),&nbsp;not
the total amounts of independent components, but rather the amounts of
aqueous
species are moved between nodes. Conversely, after the mass transport
step,
only the speciation vector</span> <span
 style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">xDC</span>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">is changed in

 style="">&nbsp;</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In

<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: left;">I<span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">n order to make this
unnecessary, the TNode class provides
a variant of</span> <span

<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">function call

new</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">bIC</span>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">bulk composition
vector is performed inside of GEMIPM2K before the internal mass scaling
and calculation
of new equilibrium state. Actually, total amounts of Independent
Components are
calculated from stoichiometries of Dependent Components (as provided in
the </span><span
 style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> matrix) and their
amounts (in the</span> <span
 style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">xDC</span>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">vector passed
through the</span> <span
 style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">p_xDC</span>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">parameter), and
then added to the amounts given in the</span> <span
 style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">bIC</span> <span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">vector (passed through</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">p_bIC</span>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">parameter).
Here,
two cases are possible. One case is when the mass transport step puts
in the</span> <span
 style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">p_xDC</span> <span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">parameter the </span><u
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">differences</u><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
between the new and the old speciation in the node chemical system. In
this
case, the old</span> <span
 style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">p_bIC</span>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">content (e.g.
unchanged since the last GEM calculation for this node) must be
provided and it will be automatically corrected.&nbsp; Another (more
usual) case
is when the mass-transport part delivers in</span> <span
 style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">p_xDC</span> <span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">the complete new
speciation (absolute
amounts) after the transport time step. In this case, the</span> <span
 style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">p_bIC</span> <span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">vector must be
filled with zeros because its new content will be completely retrieved
from the</span>
p_<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">xDC</span>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">vector.</span></p>

 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">call and yet another
variant of </span><span
 style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">GEM_from_MT()</span>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">function that
control what initial approximation of GEM speciation vector will
be used. Basically, regardless of what the mass transport part does
(especially
when the internal mass re-scaling is activated and the same</span> <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">InternalMass </span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">value
is used for all nodes), the GEMIPM2K can use previous contents of
speciation
and activity coefficients vectors in MULTI structure as an initial
approximation for the next GEM calculation &#8211; even if the bulk
composition b or
temperature T have had changed. This mode is set by the default</span> <span
 style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">uPrimalSol</span>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">parameter value</span>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt; text-align: left;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Another, more
efficient variant</span> (<span
 style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">uPrimalSol = true</span>)
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">can be used when
the mass transport part directly changes the chemical speciation in the
node while
taking care of material balance, and the</span> <span
 style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">bIC</span> <span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">input vector must be
restored anyway from
the new</span> <span
 style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">xDC</span> <span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">vector contents
(provided together with activity coefficients stored for this
node at previous time step). In this case, the SIA mode is very
efficient because
the mass balance is already ensured, and this may lead to a very
serious reduction
of the number of GEM iterations and total computing time</span>. <span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;Note that this
SIA mode works only when the
DATACH structure contains a full list of Dependent Components used in
GEM calculations.</span></p>

<br>
<h3><a name="TAG_TNODEARRAY"></a>3.4. TNodeArray class for the advanced
coupled code development<br>
</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Using the
TNodeArray class, you can implement a simple direct coupling scheme
between FMT and GEM part in a single-GEM-call fashion, assuming that
the node-specific chemical speciation and transport properties are kept
in two node arrays C0 and C1. The<br>
TNodeArray class implements a flexible C/C++ interface between GEM
IPM2K and FMT codes. It works with one DATACH and many DATABR memory
structures fully using the TNode class functionality. <br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The basic
idea of TNodeArray class is to maintain two arrays of pointers to
DATABR structures: one array C0 for the previous (</span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">t0</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">) and one C1 for the
current time (</span><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">t1</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">).&nbsp; The DATABR
structures keeping information for each node are dynamically allocated.
The mass transport part takes data for nodes from the C0 layer of the
node array and puts modified speciation, composition, or temperature
for each node in the respective structure linked to the C1 layer of the
node array. The GEM calculations (chemical equilibration) are always
performed over the nodes in C1 node array layer. Then, in the
(oprional) back-coupling algorithm, the decision about the acceptance
of the time step </span><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">dt</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> is made. The time
step can always be made smaller and the transport loop can be repeated,
if necessary, followed by the chemical&nbsp; equilibration loop. Only
when the time step is accepted, the data for each node are copied into
the respective DATABR structures in the C0 node array. <br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Code
fragments below illustrate how the TNodeArray functionality can be used
in implementing a new coupled RMT code (see also </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">main.cpp</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; file in&nbsp; </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">nodearray-gem/</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> subdirectory).&nbsp;
At the first step, two node arrays are allocated using the TNodeArray
constructor. Then the initial distribution index list </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">nodeIn[] </span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">is defined, and the
GEMIPM2K input files are read in.&nbsp; The contents of</span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"> nodeIn</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> tell the program
where to copy the contents of just read DBR file. In this way, the </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">GEM_init()</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> function initializes
the </span><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">C0&nbsp;</span></big><span

array. <br>

  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Select and
load a required SysEq record. Then go to menu "Data"
and then "Write IPM files". In the appearing list of independent
components, mark those you wish to handle in DBR files (or select all)
and click "Ok". In the next list, select dependent components (chemical
species) to be handled in DBR files (or select all) and click "Ok". In
the next list, select phases to be handled in DBR files (or select
all), and press "Ok". Finally, in the appearing file dialog, give a
name to the file set and select a directory (or create a new one) where
to write the files. The GEMIPM2K text files produced in this way are
immediately readable by GEMIPM2K.</span> </p>
