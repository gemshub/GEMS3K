  <h2><a name="1-INTRO"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Modern
approaches to reactive mass transport (RMT) or fluid mass transport
(FMT) modelling require simultaneous account for the mass transport of
contaminants through aqueous and/or gas phase in subsurface, together
with their
interaction with wall-rock minerals by means of (ad)sorption,
mineral (co)precipitation, dissolution, etc.&nbsp; These chemical
processes depend on the redox state of the system, are inherently
complex,
and may involve many phases and chemical species, some of which are
kinetically dependent. Such interactions may indirectly affect the mass
transport
via the porosity and permeability changes e.g. due to mineral
dissolution or
precipitation. </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Direct
inclusion of all possible chemical reactions in the mass transport
model may render it intractable in 2D or 3D space.
If this is the case, the chemical model must be dramatically simplified
to a
few reactions, which makes its chemical plausibility doubtful. The
modeller must make (often arbitrary) decisions which chemical
interactions are relevant and which can be neglected. <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">An
alternative approach would be to keep a complex enough chemical model
in a kind of "black box" which can be applied separately to each
node of the FMT model at each given time point <span
 style="font-style: italic;">t</span>.&nbsp; The&nbsp; input of
the "chemical black box" at time <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span>&nbsp;
is just the vector of bulk chemical composition <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b</span>
of the reactive part of the node, as well as temperature <span
 style="font-style: italic;">T</span>, pressure <span
 style="font-style: italic;">P</span>, and optionally, kinetic
constraints <span style="font-style: italic;">k</span> on some
reactions or amounts of certain components. Some or all of these inputs
could have been changed by the mass transport part on its previous
iteration time step <span style="font-style: italic;">t-</span>1.&nbsp;
  <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Now, the
"chemical black box" equilibration is applied
to each node independently at time point <span
 style="font-style: italic;">t</span>,
to produce changed speciation <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>
(amounts of chemical species in all reactive
phases),&nbsp; new phase volumes, redox (Eh, pe of aqueous solution,
gas fugacities), chemical potentials of components, etc. This
procedure can also detect a disappearance of some phases or
appearance of some new phases in some nodes (e.g., by dissolution or
precipitation of solids). <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">After the
"chemistry" run over all nodes is
finished, the next time step of the FMT algorithm can be done for the
time point <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span>+1, using the
updated concentrations of mobile species (also pH, Eh, f(H2), ... ) in
aqueous
and/or gas phases at time <span style="font-style: italic;">t.</span>
The FMT part redistributes matter between nodes (under mass
concervation), thus producing corrected compositions of reactive part
of
each node. So, the coupled RMT algorithm actually runs over all nodes
twice at the time point <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span>:&nbsp;
once doing a mass transport iteration using node compositions obtained
earlier (at <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span>-1), and
then&nbsp; by applying the "chemical black box" to each node at time <span
 style="font-style: italic;">t</span>, producing the updated speciation
which will be used by the FMT part at the next time point&nbsp; <span
 style="font-style: italic;">t</span>+1.</p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This
idea of "reactor-splitting" coupling is not really new and it has
already been implemented in a number of
coupled codes (PHREEQC, RockFlow, MCOTAC, ....). These codes
use different mass transport algorithms, but in most cases the same
type of chemical
solver based on the law of mass action (LMA) and the Newton-Raphson
method
for minimizing the mass balance deviations. However, another type of
chemical solvers based on Gibbs energy minimization (GEM) can also
be&nbsp;
coupled with the FMT codes. </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Both LMA and
GEM can solve the so-called&nbsp; forward
chemical modeling problem, which consists in finding
concentrations (or
amounts) and activities of chemical species in aqueous and other phases
present
in a complex chemical system in an equilibrium state defined by
temperature <span style="font-style: italic;">T</span>, pressure <span
 style="font-style: italic;">P</span>, and the
system bulk composition <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>. In
practice, calculations for
solving such problems range from trivial to complex,
depending on
the number of species, phases, and stoichiometry units. The complexity
further
increases when several phases-solutions with redox sensitive components
are
included in the mass balance; a typical case is the aqueous - solid
solution (Aq-SS) system which also involves a non-ideal fluid (gas
mixture) phase. Even more complex systems can be considered, e.g. those
involving (ad)sorption on several co-existing stable or metastable
sorbents. </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Chemical
speciation problems were traditionally solved with help of the LMA
codes,
supported with tools for calculation of
Lippmann functions and saturation indexes. A good introduction
into modern LMA chemical speciation numerical
methods can be found in several textbooks [<a
 href="#Ref_Van-Zeggeren-1970">Van Zeggeren and Storey,
1970</a>; <a href="#Ref_Morel-Hering-1993">Morel and Hering, 1993</a>;
  <a href="#Ref_Bethke-1996">Bethke, 1996</a>] and in the manuals of
speciation codes such as PHREEQC [<a href="#Ref_Parkhurst-Appelo-1999">Parkhurst
and Appelo, 1999</a>] or CHESS
[<a href="#Ref_van-der-Lee-1998">van der Lee, 1998</a>]. <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
advantages of LMA - excellent mass balance accuracy and fast
convergence - are best revealed in the case of simple aqueous
speciation models with known stable pure solid phase assemblage and
known Eh and fugacities of gases. The LMA codes require thermodynamic
data only for the product species (usually aqueous/surface complexes,
minerals, and gases), but not for the master species (usually aqueous
ions) - this "input data economy" can also be viewed as an advantage in
some cases.<br>
  <br>
  <a name="CRITIQUE-LMA"></a>However,
solving with LMA code complex equilibria that involve the aqueous
electrolyte phase, many possible condensed phases including solid
solutions or fluids is,
in general, an inefficient and awkward process. Different approaches
are used in LMA chemical solvers. In the Geochemists Workbench [<a
 href="#Ref_Bethke-1996">Bethke,1996</a>],&nbsp; any pure mineral phase
is taken as master species. Because there is no way to mix master
species, this program cannot handle solid solutions or gas mixture at
all. Other LMA codes (such as PHREEQC) consider minerals and gases as
product species. As pointed by [<a href="#Ref_Reed-1982">Reed, 1982</a>],
usually no solids are taken into mass balance in the initial speciation
calculation; after it is done, the saturation indexes are computed for
each stoichiometrically feasible mineral phase, the mineral with the
highest oversaturation is included into the mass balance, the
speciation is computed again, and this loop is repeated until no
supersaturated phases are left in the list. <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The real problem
in LMA approach is how to determine the saturation index of the solid
solution
phase or the gas mixture. For the ideal (solid) solution, this can be
done over iterations using ionic mole fractions
available from aqueous speciation. For non-ideal SS, this is a problem
which has
no general solution, as explained on Page 94 in [<a
 href="#Ref_Bruno_ea_2007">Bruno et al, 2007</a>]. Because of that, the
LMA chemical solvers can at best treat only ideal solution phases and
simple binary non-ideal solid solutions that can be described using
Lippmann functions and diagrams. If many solids and/or solid solutions
are potentially present,&nbsp; a simple LMA aqueous
speciation calculation turns into a series of many runs controlled by
non-rigorous
test procedures for selecting (over)saturated solids one-by-one,
without a theoretical guarantee of
convergence to a unique result. This kind of retardation is difficult
to evaluate, but, with a large list of possible condensed phases, more
than ten LMA sub-runs may be required to include all stable solids
into
mass balance.&nbsp;<br>

  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">These drawbacks
of LMA approach are not relevant in a
complementary GEM approach [for details, see <a
 href="#Ref_Karpov-ea-1997">Karpov et
al., 1997</a>; <a href="#Ref_Karpov-ea-2001">2001</a>; <a
 href="#Ref_Kulik-ea-2004">Kulik et al., 2004</a>; <a
 href="#Ref_Bruno_ea_2007">Bruno et al., 2007</a>], where total mole
amounts of
chemical
elements <span style="font-style: italic;">n<sub>i</sub></span><sub> </sub>and
(zero)
charge <span style="font-style: italic;">n<sub>z</sub></span> comprise
the
input bulk composition of the chemical system expressed using <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>)
independent components
(IC). All&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">L</span>) stoichiometrically
feasible chemical species or dependent
components (DC) are taken
into the mass balance
through their chemical formulae and mole amounts <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n<sub>j</sub></span>. A given <span
 style="font-style: italic;">j</span>-th dependent
component belongs to a single- or
multi-component aqueous, gaseous, fluid, liquid, solid, or sorption
phase.
The stability of <span style="font-style: italic;">j</span>-th DC at
temperature <span style="font-style: italic;">T</span> and pressure <span
 style="font-style: italic;">P</span>
of
interest is defined by its molar Gibbs energy function <span
 style="font-style: italic;">g<sub>T,P</sub></span>. Activities and
concentrations
of dependent components are treated separately in each phase, taking
into account the appropriate standard and
reference states, concentration scales, and models of (non)ideal
mixing. </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Conversely,
GEM
algorithms can solve complex Aq-SS
equilibria in one GEM run, in a
straightforward way, without any supporting tools such as Lippmann
functions or semi-empirical iterative procedures required in LMA Aq-SS
speciation
models. The applicability of GEM to chemical systems is limited only by
the knowledge of
standard-state molar properties of end-members and the non-ideal
interaction
parameters for each phase.</p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
disadvantages of GEM in comparison with LMA codes are (i) slower
convergence in simple aqueous speciation calculations
and (ii) less mass balance accuracy. The performance of GEM can be
dramatically improved using the previous equilibrium speciation as an
initial approximation
for the new run (in "smart initial approximation" mode). The mass
balance accuracy can be made comparable to that of LMA at the cost of a
few additional
GEM iterations (the IPM-2 algorithm), as described in [<a
 href="#Ref_TM-44-02-06">Chudnenko ea,
2002</a>]. </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Performance and
chemical feasibility of GEM in complex Aq-SS multiphase
systems may be much better than that of LMA codes
(though no
direct benchmarking is yet available). Another advantage of
GEM method (in "convex programming" variant) is that it yields two
solutions - the "primal" <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>
for speciation
(analogous to LMA) and the "dual" <span style="font-style: italic;">u</span>
for chemical potentials of
stoichiometry units (not available from LMA solvers). The dual solution
may open
innovative ways to constructing mass transport models for
diffusion-dominated systems, since the
diffusion of any component is driven by the gradient of its chemical
potential.</p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
present program package GEMIPM2K is an implementation of GEM IPM-2
chemical
solver with a simple data exchange interface that makes it possible to
couple any existing FMT code with the GEM&nbsp; "chemical black box" to
produce a coupled modeling code with high chemical plausibility. As
there is no GUI and data exchange occurs via files or in RAM, such code
can be parallelized and compiled on various platforms up to HPC
clusters.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The traditional
"operator-splitting" coupling, where the chemical information for all
nodes is
stored in the mass transport part which calls the chemical solver for
each node one-by-one, is
supported by the TNode C++ class (and its fortran interface). When a
new FMT code is written, the whole data storage for all nodes can be
organized using a TNodeArray C++ class into two node arrays (for time t
and t-1), with each node accessible
from the GEM IPM-2 routines or from the FMT program. </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This
document describes the structure of GEMIPM2K program and the data
exchange interface (DATACH and DATABR structures), followed by an
overview of TNode and TNodeArray classes and examples of their
usage. In a companion document <a href="gemipm2k-inp.html">gemipm2k-inp.html</a>,
the format of GEMIPM2K text input/output files is described together
with the reference on data objects encountered in these files. Most of
these data objects are the same as in GEM-Selektor; hyperlinks are

extracted from the <st1:stockticker w:st="on">GEMS</st1:stockticker>-<st1:stockticker
 w:st="on">PSI</st1:stockticker> code package for thermodynamic
modelling by Gibbs energy minimization (<st1:stockticker w:st="on">GEM</st1:stockticker>).
GEMIPM2K implements the GEM chemical solver linked to TMulti C++ class
and data structure, enhanced with <st1:stockticker w:st="on">RAM</st1:stockticker>-
and file- data exchange interfaces implemented in TNode and TNodeArray
classes. <br>

 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><st1:stockticker
 w:st="on"></st1:stockticker> GEMIPM2K has been designed for
coupling the <st1:stockticker w:st="on">GEM</st1:stockticker> chemical
solver with
existing and new fluid-mass-transport (<st1:stockticker w:st="on">FMT</st1:stockticker>)
codes. The program source code is compatible with <st1:stockticker

C++ and can be compiled on many computer platforms (Windows, Linux, <st1:stockticker

optimizing
compilers (GNU C++, <st1:stockticker w:st="on">PGI</st1:stockticker>
C++, Intel
C++, Microsoft C++, &#8230; ). <br>
  </span></p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
input data can be provided in human-readable ASCII files, the

data
exchange with a transport code part can be performed in <st1:stockticker
 w:st="on">RAM</st1:stockticker>
using&nbsp; DATACH
and&nbsp; DATABR data structures.
This data exchange interface is implemented in two C++ classes &#8211; TNode

  </span></p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
TNode class provides functionality for attaching GEMIPM2K
kernel to an existing transport model code which keeps the chemical
information
for all nodes and calls <st1:stockticker w:st="on">GEM</st1:stockticker>
calculation for each node separately. The TNodeArray class is built on
top of the TNode class and can store both chemical and dynamic data
for all nodes of the mass transport problem. Recalculation of
equilibrium
states in all nodes after the mass transport step can be done with a
single call (with
internal parallelization possible). This may be suitable for developing
of a
new coupled code. The GEMIPM2K source code is expected to be
distributed under
LGPL or similar license.<br>

  <h3><a name="IPM2-OPERATION"></a>2.1. Brief overview of GEM IPM2
module operation<br>
  </h3>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The GEM IPM2
algorithm is described in a companion PSI Technical Report [<a
 href="#Ref_Kulik_ea-2008">Kulik et
al., 2008</a>] , as well as in earlier report [<a
 href="#Ref_TM-44-02-06">Chudnenko et al., 2002</a>]. A short overview
is given in [<a href="#Ref_Bruno_ea_2007">Bruno et al., 2007</a>],
pages 94-104. Recently, the speed of GEM IPM-2 calculations has been
dramatically increased [<a href="#Ref_Dmytrieva-2008">Dmytrieva et al.,
2008</a>] and now is comparable with that of LMA codes, at least in
"smart initial approximation" mode. <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The basic idea of
the GEM IPM algorithm consists in finding such a distribution vector <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n </span>of bulk chemical composition of
the system <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span> over its
thermodynamic phases and their components that the total Gibbs energy <span
 style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>)
of the system is at minimum at temperature and pressure of interest.
Each phase component (chemical species) is represented by its
stoichiometry and the standard chemical potential (molar Gibbs energy
function <span style="font-style: italic;">g</span><sup>o</sup>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">T,P</span>)) at temperature <span
 style="font-style: italic;">T</span> and pressure <span
 style="font-style: italic;">P</span> of interest. As seen on Fig. 2-1,
the process consists of four major steps. <br>

the <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span>) minimum, so that the GEM process
would succeed in finding the solution of the problem. In principle, any
previously calculated speciation vector<span style="font-style: italic;">
n</span> for this setup of thermodynamic system (even for different <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b, T, P</span>) can be used as initial
approximation in "smart initial approximation" (SIA) mode. If no
previous solution is available at all, or the available one is bad,
then the so-called "automatic initial approximation" (AIA) must
obtained by solving a linear programming (LP) sub-problem using a
modified simplex method. <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The LP
sub-problem is constructed by truncating all the mixing terms from
chemical potential expressions for all components of phases-solutions,
which is equivalent to considering any component as a pure phase. Given
  <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">N</span>) Independent Components (usually
chemical elements and charge) in the bulk composition vector <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, the simplex solution contains at
most <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">N</span>) non-zero elements in the AIA
speciation vector <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>(AIA).
This is also consistent with the Gibbs phase rule. <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Usually, the
number of aqueous species is greater than <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>).
If the number of stoichiometrically possible phases exceeds n(N), such
system is called "multisystem" [Karpov et al., 1997]. Equilibria in
multisystems cannot be solved directly by LMA algorithm (see a <a
 href="#CRITIQUE-LMA">comment here</a>), but such equilibria can be
solved in one GEM run, if the initial approximation belongs to the
so-called "feasible domain". So, the second step consists in checking
whether the AIA or SIA vector <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>
is feasible, i.e. whether the mass balance residuals for all
independent components are small enough. This is usually so in the case
of previously available SIA vector. But the AIA vector contains many
zero amounts of chemical species (dependent components) which may be
relevant aqueous species or form stable condensed or fluid phases,
although this is not a priori known. For that reason, the zero mole
amounts in the AIA initial approximation are filled out with a default
amount (1e-7 - 1e-6 mol) which then would increase or decrease upon GEM
iterations depending on the stability of the chemical species in this
chemical system. If the current amount of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">j</span>-th species <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n<sub>j</sub></span> falls below a certain
numerical threshold (ca. 1e-20 mol), it will be zeroed off. This
eliminates the <span style="font-style: italic;">j</span>-th species
from subsequent GEM iterations in order to avoid numerical troubles.
However, if the total amount of a phase falls below another threshold
(Pa_DS between 1e-9 and 1e-12 mol) then all components in this phase
will be zeroed off and the whole phase is eliminated from next GEM
iterations.<br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The fill-out
procedure in AIA bears also a danger that the mass balance is violated.
Hence, a special EFD() algorithm checks the mass balance residuals and
tries to change the largest elements of the AIA vector in such a way
that the mass balance accuracy would be at least satisfactory (i.e.
deviations less than 1e-7 mol). This is usually done in a few
iterations, and then the initial approximation vector is ready for the
main GEM algorithm. <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><a
 name="EFD_PROCEDURE"></a>The third step is
to adjust the elements of <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>speciation
vector <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> to minimize the
total Gibbs energy of the system <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span>) while keeping mass balance
deviations the same or lower as inherited from the EFD() step. This is
the core of IPM-2 algorithm - it approaches the GEM problem using the
duality (Kuhn-Tucker) theorem by introducing Lagrange multipliers <span
 style="font-style: italic;">u<sub>i</sub></span> conjugate to the
elements <span style="font-style: italic;">b<sub>i</sub></span> of the
bulk composition vector. These Lagrange multipliers form the so-called
"dual solution" of the GEM problem (the "primal solution" being the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span> speciation vector). The total
Gibbs energy of the system can be calculated either as <span
 style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>)
= sum(<span style="font-style: italic;">n<sub>j</sub> v<sub>j</sub></span>)
where <span style="font-style: italic;">v<sub>j</sub></span> = <span
 style="font-style: italic;">f</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">g</span><sup>o</sup><sub><span
 style="font-style: italic;">j</span></sub>, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span>) is the primal chemical potential
of j-th dependent component., or as <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) = sum(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">b<sub>i</sub> u<sub>i</sub></span>).
Towards equilibrium, <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span>) scalar value approaches a
(global) minimum which equals the <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) (global) maximum. Hence, the
criterion of convergence can be constructed using any normalized
function of <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span>) - <span
 style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)
which is ideally zero, but numerically must be below a small threshold
(for the quadratic Dikin's criterion, DK &lt; Pa_DK = 1e-4).&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Each iteration of
IPM consists of three steps. First, a new dual solution approximation <span
 style="font-style: italic;">u</span> is found by solving with the
Cholesky decomposition method a SLE constructed from the previous
primal solution, stoichiometry matrix and weight multipliers. Next, the
vector of descent direction is found by comparing primal and dual
chemical potentials for each dependent component. Finally, a step
length multiplier is determined from a condition that no new nj value
should break the "feasible domain" of mass balance and metastability
constraints. The new approximation of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span> speciation vector is found by
incrementing non-zero elements of the old one with a product of the
respective element of the descent direction vector and the scalar step
length. Convergence is usually achieved in 1-10 iterations in the SIA
and 20 to 100 iterations in the simplex AIA case. <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The fourth step
is called "phase selection" (implemented in PhaseSelect() function). It
consists in calculation of Karpov's phase stability criteria for each
multi-component phase present in non-zero amount, as well as for each
pure phase, either zeroed off or not. The stability criteria have been
derived from the Karpov-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of equilibrium state
that compare primal and dual estimates of chemical potential for each
component. For any stable component in a stable phase, the value of
such criterion must be close to zero.&nbsp; However, if the initial
approximation was bad, or there were errors in stoichiometry or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">g</span><sup>o</sup> value for a dependent
component, <span style="font-style: italic;"></span> the value of
Karpov's criterion may indicate that a phase present in the mass
balance is unstable and must be excluded, or vice versa - a phase
absent from the mass balance (zeroed off) is stable and must be
included. If any such phase has been detected, it is zeroed off
respectively its component amounts are filled out with small amounts,
and the whole sequence is repeated from Step two (but without the
overall fill-out step). If, after three such refinement loops, the
PhaseSelect() still finds inconsistent phases, the behavior of GEM IPM
algorithm depends on the original initial approximation. If it was SIA,
the mode is automatically switched to AIA and calculation begin "from
scratch", i.e. from solving the LP sub-problem for a generic IA. If it
was AIA, an error message is generated and the GEM solution is not
accepted. <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The flow-chart
described above applies when all elements of the bulk composition
vector (except charge) exceed 1e-6 mol. However, if there are some
elements less than 1e-7 mol, the IPM algorithm starting with AIA may
fail with the corresponding mass balance residual which may also be of
the same order of magnitude or even higher (i.e. the mass balance error
may be from 50% to 1000%). The reason for that is the "fill-out" step
spoils the mass balance and the EFD() procedure cannot recover it
completely. In this sutiation, the IPM-2 algorithm is invoked, which in
the case of AIA first runs as the generic IPM algorithm. Even with bad
mass balance precision, this step yields a solution which lies very
close to the <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span>(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span>) minimum and can be used as a
very good initial approximation where the fill-out procedure is not
needed (because all stable phases and components are already known) and
the mass balance residuals thresholds in the EFD-2() procedure can be
set at much lower levels, separately for different independent
components. This is the idea of IPM-2 refinement loops: after
convergence of GEM descent and PhaseSelect() check, an additional check
for the fullfillment of severe mass balance requirements is performed.
If there are still some bad residuals, the loop is repeated with just
obtained approximation of the <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>
vector from the EFD-2() procedure. In most cases, up to 15 such loops
are sufficient to provide a GEM solution with 0.1% maximum mass balance
residual even for the smallest "trace" independent component present in
1e-14 mol total amount. <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A similar
sequence of refinement loops can be applied when two or more non-ideal
solution phases are present near the critical point of their solvus. In
such a system, the difference in molar Gibbs energy of such phases
becomes tiny and up to 20 refinement GEM-IPM2 runs may be required to
obtain correct speciation. Such systems, however, are rare and in
principle cannot be solved with LMA algorithms. <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">All these
numerical paths of the iterative GEM IPM-2 algorithm are controlled
through ca. 20 thresholds and flags, values of which were empirically
found in many test and modelling calculations in various systems. These

  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The GEM
IPM-2 algorithm is implemented as a set of C++ functions belonging to
the TMulti class that all use data and lists provided in a single
instance of the&nbsp; MULTI data structure also inserted into the
TMulti class. Before any GEM calculation, all data arrays must be
allocated according to current number of components and phases, and all
input data must be correctly filled into these arrays. <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In the
GEMS-PSI GUI environment, this is done automatically before any GEM
calculation is started. The data of the "internal" GEM problem are
compressed into MULTI data structure by collecting the items from the
project system lists and arrays, as well as from the thermodynamic data
base. In the project system lists, many independent components,
dependent components, and phases may be switched off by the user. Only
the names and data for components and phases that are switched on are
copied into the MULTI structure. If necessary, the scripts for
calculating activity coefficients of components of non-ideal solution
phases are also compressed, together with any needed coefficients for
non-ideal interaction parameters or surface complexation models picked
up from the Phase database records. This makes the GEMS GUI setup of
thermodynamic models very flexible, though rendering its software
implementation rather complicated. <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This route
cannot be followed in the standalone GEMIPM2K program and any programs
using it. The purpose of GEMIPM2K is to keep the code implementation
and handling of I/O data as simple as possible. This is the
prerequisite for compiling the cupled FMT-GEM program on any computer
architecture, up to parallel HPC clusters. Consequently, the GEMIPM2K
program has no GUI, no direct access to thermodynamic data base, and it
has no script interpreter included. It uses only data for a
"compressed" GEM problem thoroughly contained in the MULTI structure
(i.e. no components or phases that were switched off from the lists are
allowed). Because of that, some restrictions apply in GEMIPM2K relative
to GEMS-PSI code: <br>

In principle,&nbsp; all the input data required for GEM IPM-2
calculation can be provided in a human-made ASCII file. However,
producing such file without a software front-end that can accessing the
thermodynamic data base would be a difficult and error-prone
process. <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Moreover,
RMT problems are usually represented by many nodes; reactive subsystems
in all these nodes can share the same chemical system definition (CSD)
and would usually differ only in bulk chemical composition (,
temperature and pressure). Hence, it would make no sense to use the
MULTI data structure directly for data exchange with the mass-transport
part. Often, not all independent and dependent components must take
place in exchange with the MT part - only those components that are
somehow transported from node to node. <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">For these
reasons, the whole content of the MULTI and BASE_PARAM data structures
required for a GEM IPM-2 calculation has been subdivided into three
main parts, or data sub-sets (covered with the respective I/O files): <br>

inside of the TNode class. <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
advantage of having three kinds of input files instead of one is that
in a typical RMT problem with hudreds of thousands of nodes, only one
relatively large DCH and one IPM file is needed, while node-specific
data are provided in many small and compact input-output DBR files
without redundant information. As a consequence,&nbsp; higher
performance and flexibility of the coupled code can be achieved. <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In the
current implementation of GEMIPM2K, two file I/O modes are possible:
binary stream and text stream. Binary stream DCH, DBR and IPM files are
simply images of the respective memory data structures; they may be
non-transferable between different computer architectures. The text
stream files are transferable; they have a human-readable format with
tags (keywords) followed with the data; comment lines are possible
anywhere. For most data items, the input order is free, or they can be
skipped if the program can substitute default values.&nbsp; Only&nbsp;
dimenions necessary for internal data allocation must be present at the
beginning of DCH and IPM files. More about the file structure of
GEMIPM2K is provided in <a href="#INPUT_FILES">section 5 of this manual</a>,
as well as in the <a href="gemipm2k-inp.html">companion manual</a>.<br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><a
 name="GEMS_GENERATE_INPUT_FILES"></a>In order to
facilitate preparation of GEMIPM2K input files, the GEMS-PSI code has
two ways of generating them automatically.&nbsp; One way is to set up
the chemical system in "Single thermodynamic system" dialog, calculate
equilibrium, and save it into SysEq record (see <a
 href="http://gems.web.psi.ch/screenshots/sshgal01.html">Screenshot
tutorial</a> for details). To produce the GEMIPM2 input files, follow
the <a href="#PRODUCE_FILES_S">instructions here</a>. From the same
GEMS dialog, it is even possible to upload a set of GEMIPM2K files
after GEMIPM2K or coupled code calculations (you must be in the same
modelling project system from which the initial GEMIPM2K files were
generated).&nbsp; In this way, you can conveniently explore results of
GEMIPM2K run for a single system, e.g., after changing manually some
input data in DBR or IPM file. <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Another way
to create a set of GEMIPM2K input files for
multiple nodes is to set up a GEM2MT module record of "S" type (see
documentation to GEM2MT, under construction). Re-calculation of such
record results in a collection of one DCH, one IPM and multiple DBR
files sufficient to
set ip initial systems and start a coupled modelling session. </span><br>

Implementation of this functionality is located in the <big><span

(GEMIPM2K-specific variant of <big><span

function, and <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">node.cpp</span></big>
(<big><span style="font-family: monospace;">TNode::check_grid_TP()</span></big>
function)) files. In addition, the <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">TNode</span></big> class provides
methods for accessing interpolated thermodynamic data from the
mass-transport part at any time through the <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">DATACH</span></big> memory structure (<big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">TNode::DC_G0_TP()</span></big>, <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">TNode::DC_V0_TP()</span></big>,
etc.)&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The trivial case
of lookup is when <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">nTp</span></big>
= 1 and <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">nPp</span></big> =
1 (0-D interpolation). In this case, each thermodynamic data array (see
the table below) must contain one
value per DC for a single temperature <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">TCval[0]</span></big> and pressure <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Pval[0]</span></big>. Conversely, no
variations in <span style="font-style: italic;">T,P</span> between the
nodes or with
time will then be allowed in the coupled model. Actually, the program
checks that current <span style="font-style: italic;">T</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">P</span> coincide with a value from <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">TCval </span></big>resp. <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Pval</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"></span></big> within the tolerance
limits given in <big><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Ttol</span></big> and <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Ptol</span></big>, respectively, and
picks up the values from grid arrays.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The more common
case is when the pressure is fixed (<big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">nPp</span></big> =
1) but the temperature in the nodes is allowed to change (e.g. <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">nTp</span></big>=
8). Then the <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">Pval</span></big>
array must contain a single value of pressure (e.g.
10 bar) and the <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">Tval</span></big>
array - 8 values of temperature in ascending order
(e.g. 5, 25, 45, 65, 85, 105, 125, 145 <sup>o</sup>C). These values
define the overall temperature interval
{4.9; 145.1 <sup>o</sup>C}. The differences between adjacent
temperature values
must not
necessarily be equal. According to this setup, the <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">roW</span></big> and <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">EpsW</span></big> arrays
must contain 8 values each that correspond to 10 bar pressure and the
temperatures given in <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">Tval</span></big>
array. Provided that there are 40 dependent
components in the DCH list, the <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">G0</span></big> array will consist of
8 values per
DC, i.e. total 320 numbers, the first 8 contain <span
 style="font-style: italic;">G</span><sup>o</sup> values for the first
species (for temperatures in <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">Tval</span></big>),
next 8 values - for the second
species, and so on. The <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">V0</span></big>
array should be organized likewise. The
interpolation subroutine looks then separately for each dependent
component to return <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span><sup>o</sup>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">V</span><sup>o</sup> values for <span
 style="font-style: italic;">P</span>=10 bar and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">T</span> of interest,
interpolated in 1-D mode, if necessary. <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In the most
general
case, the lookup grid arrays contain numbers for several discrete
pressures and several discrete temperatures. Then the <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">roW</span></big> and <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">epsW</span></big>
arrays are actually&nbsp; tables made of rows each containing values
for different
temperatures from <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">Tval</span></big>
but one pressure value from <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">Pval</span></big>.
The <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">G0 </span></big>and <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">V0</span></big>
arrays are then composed of such tables for each dependent component,
arranged in the order in which the dependent components are listed in
the DATACH <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">DCNL</span></big>
list. The interpolation subroutine performs 2-D interpolation
separately for each dependent component to return its <span
 style="font-style: italic;">G</span><sup>o</sup> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">V</span><sup>o</sup> values
for <span style="font-style: italic;">P,T</span> of interest.&nbsp;
&nbsp; </p>
  <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Thus, the
lookup grid
arrays of thermodynamic data permit GEMIPM2K to extract thermodynamic
data for any current <span style="font-style: italic;">T</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">P</span> in any node, provided that <span
 style="font-style: italic;">T</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">P</span> are
within the respective ranges set in </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">TCval</span></big><span

 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Before calling the

and <span style="font-style: italic;">V</span><sup>o</sup> values are
loaded directly into the MULTI
structure, where they remain as long as the input <span
 style="font-style: italic;">P</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">T</span> do not
change. New
interpolation is done when the requested <span

  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The trivial
(default) case is when <big> <span style="font-family: monospace;">nICb

nPS.<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In this
case, the data vectors in DATABR structure exactly map the
corresponding data vectors in DATACH and MULTI structures. For
instance, the bulk chemical composition of the system - vector </span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">b</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> in MULTI - is the
same as the vector </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">bIC</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> provided in the
DATABR structure or DBR file. The index one-to-one mapping lists </span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">xIC, xDC</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> and </span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">xPH</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> will also be
trivial. For instance, given 7 independent components in the system (</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">nIC</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> = 7), the </span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">xIC</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> array will simply
contain ascending indexes (</span><span style="font-family: monospace;">0,1,2,3,4,5,6</span><span

  </span></span></big></p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><span

significantly accelerate data exchange and reduce memory size of the
coupled FMT-GEM problem when some ICs, DCs and phases are not
considered in transport between the nodes. For example, the
break-through columns
in experiments are often filled with quartz sand, dissolution of which
can be neglected, so the transport of dissolved silica can also be
neglected.&nbsp; For a system involving calcium and magnesium,
carbonate, and chloride, the&nbsp; DATACH lists in this case will look

  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Now, suppose that our
mass transport model does not consider the transport of gas phase,
electric charge, and of dissolved silicium species (non-transported
components and species are marked red in the lists above). Some
aqueous species and solids are very unlikely to appear </span></span></big><big><span

 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">(marked in pink)</span></span></big><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> and thus
can also be considered irrelevant for the MT model . Then&nbsp;
the&nbsp; respective arrays of the DATABR structure can be made
smaller, and values in them re-mapped to DATACH or MULTI structure as
follows: <br>
  </span></span></big></p>

  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It is very important
to realize that the re-mapping does not affect any dimensions in the
MULTI structure and any DATACH lists and arrays (the latter remain
accessible in full also to the transport part of the coupled code).
Values for components and phases marked red (non-transported) are
skipped only from data arrays in all instances of the DATABR structure,
but
these components and phases are still present in DATACH and MULTI
structures and take part in the equilibration. In the above example,
the size of a DATABR instance (and DBR file) becomes more than 30% less
compared with the trivial (complete) index mapping case.&nbsp; This
decrease can be even more dramatic for some transport algorithms where
only a certain tracers move, or where the advection strongly prevails
over the diffusion. In the latter case, only the bulk aqueous solution
is migrated as the whole between the nodes, so all dependent components
of the aqueous phase can be skipped from the DATABR mapping. In the
above example, this would make the DATABR instance ca. 3-4 times
smaller
than in the trivial mapping case. <br>
  </span></span></big></p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It can be stated that
the presence of DATABR index mapping to DATACH structure provides a
great flexibility in defining various coupling schemes between the FMT
and the GEM parts. A natural question is - how the bulk composition of
the node system can be set up when the mapping list </span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">xIC</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> is incomplete?&nbsp;
A straightforward answer is - the full </span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">b</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> vector can always be
provided in the IPM file (from where it is directly loaded into the
MULTI structure). The </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">TNode</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> class also has
methods for the direct access to the </span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">b</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> vector using the
DATACH/MULTI indexation, which can be used e.g. for setting in all
nodes the initial amounts of ICs skipped from the DATABR index mapping.
Use of this functionality makes sense in 2-D or 3-D FMT problems with
relatively large chemical system definition, where it may result in
considerably less memory demand and higher performance of data
exchange. However, the use of SIA initial approximation mode of GEM
IPM2 may be restricted in this case. Hence, for 1-D columns, we
recommend
using the trivial (complete) one-to-one mapping in DATABR and DBR
files. </span></span></big></p>

  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The first
four flags are only important for the FMT part implemented at
TNodeArray level. For calling the GEM IPM-2 calculations, the</span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"> NodeStatusCH</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; flag is
extremely important. This flag sets the GEM initial approximation mode
and is reset after GEM calculation to GEM IPM-2 return code. Hence, the
MT part must reset this flag every time when the GEM calculation must
be done, and check the return value after getting the control back from
GEMIPM2K. Most important situations (at simple TNode level of
coupling): <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">AIA
(simplex) initial approximation mode of GEM calculations (slow but more
accurate and reproducible results): Before calling GEM: set </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">NodeStatusCH</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> to 1 (</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">NEED_GEM_AIA</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">). After GEM
calculation: check that </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">NodeStatusCH</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> contains 2 (</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">OK_GEM_AIA</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">). If yes then copy
GEM results to MT data structures and proceed with the next node. If
no, but </span><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">NodeStatusCH</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> contains 3 (</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">BAD_GEM_AIA</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">) then decide on
further actions (e.g. check whether the current bulk composition in the
reactive sub-system is well balanced). If NodeStatusCH contains 4 (</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">ERR_GEM_AIA</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">) or 9 (</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">T_ERROR_GEM</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">), generate a
diagnostic message and break the coupled modeling calculations. Code 9
(terminal error) usually reflects the dynamic memory corruption in GEM
IPM-2 kernel. <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">SIA (smart)
initial approximation mode of GEM calculations (fast but results may be
less accurate and, in general, not exactly reproducible): </span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Before calling GEM:
set </span><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">NodeStatusCH</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> to 5 (</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">NEED_GEM_SIA</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">). After GEM
calculation: check that </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">NodeStatusCH</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> contains 6 (</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">OK_GEM_SIA</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">) or 2 (</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">OK_GEM_AIA</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">).
If yes then copy GEM results to MT data structures and proceed with the
next node. Code 2 in this situation means that the GEM IPM algorithm
had found the node chemical speciation inappropriate as initial
approximation and has switched to the automatic (simplex) initial
approximation. Accordingly, error codes 3 or 4 mean the same as above
for the AIA start. Seldom, </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">NodeStatusCH</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> may contain 7 (</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">BAD_GEM_SIA</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">) or 8 (</span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">ERR_GEM_SIA</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">); if so, the MT part
may try re-starting GEM calculation for this node in the AIA mode. <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">IterDone</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> field can be used
after a GEM calculation for diagnostic purposes (e.g. to keep track of
GEM IPM-2 performance). The TNode class also provides several function
calls that return the elapsed and pure GEM calculation time. <br>

  <h3><a name="TNODE"></a> 2.5. The TNode Class - a Minimum Data
Exchange Interface for Coupling with Existing Transport Codes</h3>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The TNode
C++ class (defined in </span><a href="../../node.h"><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">node.h</span></big></a><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> file, implemented in
  </span><a href="../../node.cpp"><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">node.cpp</span></big></a><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> and </span><a
 href="../../node_format.cpp"><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">node_format.cpp</span></big></a><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> files) provides
methods (function calls) for easy coupling GEMIPM2K with already
existing transport codes that keep chemical information in own data
arrays. The </span><a href="../../main.cpp"><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">main.cpp</span></big></a><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> file in </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">GEMIPM2K</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> directory offers an
example of batch calculation of chemical equilibria with input data
given in DCH, IPM and one or more DBR files; the results are written
into DBR files. The </span><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">main.cpp</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> file in </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">node_gem</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> directory&nbsp;
shows how the coupling with "transport part" having chemical data for
several nodes arranged in arrays can be organized. In <a
 href="#TEST_TNODE">this example</a>, no real mass transport is
performed; its effect is just simulated by a loop that changes stepwise
bulk compositions (</span><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">bIC
  </span></big><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">vectors)
in the nodes. <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">During
initialization, the TNode class constructor dynamically allocates one
instance of TMULTI, one instance of DATACH, and one instance of DATABR
data structures. </span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The dynamic arrays in
DATACH and DATABR are allocated in </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">datach_from_text_file()</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> or </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">datach_from_file()</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> functions upon
reading the text or binary DCH file, respectively. The arrays in DATACH
are filled out with data upon further reading of DCH file. The dynamic
arrays of MULTI are allocated upon reading the IPM file, then all
relevant data are copied from DATACH to MULTI structure arrays. The
data in DATABR are read from DBR file in&nbsp; </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">databr_from_text_file()</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> or </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">databr_from_file()</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> functions. The
format of text IPM, DCH and DBR files is described in detail in a <a
 href="gemipm2k-inp.html">companion document</a>. <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As seen in
example main.cpp files from GEMIPM2K or node_gem directories, the whole
work on initializing and filling out the <br>
GEMIPM2K data structures on TNode level is done by three code lines:<br>
  </span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: monospace;"><big>TNode*
worknode&nbsp; = new TNode();<br>
if( worknode-&gt;GEM_init( input_system_file_list_name ) )<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; return 1;&nbsp; // Error in reading GEMIPM2K input files<br>
  </big></p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><small><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Here, </span></small><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">input_system_file_list_name</span></big>
is a <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">char[]</span></big>
identifier containing a string with path name of a text file with a
list of DCH, IPM and DBR input file names. For instance, assuming that
GEMIPM2K text input files <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">Test1-dat.lst,&nbsp;
Test1-dch.dat, Test1-ipm.dat</span></big> and <big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Test1-dbr-0.dat</span></big> are
prepared in <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">./testdir/</span></big>
subdirectory, the&nbsp; <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">input_system_file_list_name</span>&nbsp;</big>
should contain <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">"testdir/Test1-dat.lst"</span></big>.
The file&nbsp; <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">Test1-dat.lst</span><small><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> should contain the
following text: <br>
  </span></small></big></p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; margin-left: 40px;"><big><small><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></small></big><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">-t "Test1-dch.dat" "Test1-ipm.dat" "</span></big><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Test1-dbr-0.dat"</span></big><br>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">-t</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> key tells the
program to read text input files (</span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">-b</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> would be binary
files), then the name of DCH file, then IPM file, and at least one DBR
file (always in this order). These files must be present in the same
directory where the </span><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">*dat.lst</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> file is located.
Multiple DBR files will be read only by calling GEMIPM2K on <a
 href="#TNODEARRAY">TNodeArray level (see next section)</a>; on TNode
level, only the first DBR file is read and others will be ignored. <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">However,
the TNode class provides a function that can read other DBR files
one-by-one at any time. The simplest call is like this: <br>
  </span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">if( worknode-&gt;GEM_read_dbr(
NextRecipeFileName ) ) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; return 2; </span></big><big>// <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Error in reading DBR input file</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">NextRecipeFileName</span></big><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"></span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
is a</span> <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">char[]</span></big>
  <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">identifier
containing a string with path name of a text DBR file (in our example,
it may be &nbsp;</span> <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">"testdir/Test1-dbr-1.dat"</span></big>
)<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> Since there is
only one DATABR structure linked to the TNode class instance, this call
destroys any previous bulk composition and speciation kept in the TNode
instance&nbsp; </span><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">node</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">. <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">After the
DBR file information has been read, the chemical equilibrium can be
calculated. This is normally done with the following C++ lines:<br>
  </span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>int
StatusGEM;</big><br>
// Get direct access to work node DATABR structure which exchanges data
between GEMIPM and FMT parts<br>
  <big>DATABR* wdbr = worknode-&gt;pCNode();</big></span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>wdbr-&gt;NodeStatusCH
= NEED_GEM_AIA; </big>// Ask GEM to run with automatic initial
approximation<br>
  <big>StatusGEM = worknode-&gt;GEM_run( false );</big><br>
  </span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>if(
StatusGEM != OK_GEM_AIA )</big>&nbsp; // Check the GEM return code <br>
  <big>{</big>&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <big>cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; "Error in GEM
calculation for DBR file " <small>&lt;&lt; </small></big></span><big
 style="font-family: monospace;">NextRecipeFileName <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;&lt; " return code " &lt;&lt;
StatusGEM;<small> </small><br>
&nbsp; return 3; <br>
  </big><span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>}</big>&nbsp; </span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">After
successfull GEM calculation, the resulting speciation, activity
coefficients etc. are&nbsp; returned in the same work DATABR structure
where the input bulk composition, temperature and pressure were
provided (by reading the last DBR file). The easiest way to look at the
results is to write them back into the same DBR file: <br>
  </span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">worknode-&gt;GEM_write_dbr(
NextRecipeFileName, false, false );</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
  </span></p>
  <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The file contents
can be viewed with any text viewer or editor. You can also produce a
copy of the DBR file with current GEM input and results by using the
same call but with different file name: <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: monospace; margin-left: 40px;"><big>char
NextResultFileName[60] = "testdir/Test1-dbr-1.out";<br>
worknode-&gt;GEM_write_dbr( NextResultFileName, false, true );<br>
  </big></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The second
parameter in </span><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">GEM_write_dbr()</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> call tells the
program to produce binary (</span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">true</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">) or text (</span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">false</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">) file. The third
parameter is used only in writing text DBR files: if set to&nbsp; </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">true</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> then each data item
is printed with comment lines for better readability, otherwise without
comments. </span><br>
  <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Detailed
contents of the MULTI data structure after GEM calculation can be found
in a text file produced with a call </span><br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: monospace; margin-left: 40px;"><big>char
NextPrintoutFileName[60] = "testdir/Test1-dbr-1.IPMprint.out";<br>
worknode-&gt;GEM_print_ipm( NextPrintoutFileName );<br>
  </big></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This
formatted file cannot be read back by </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">GEM_init()</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> or </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">GEM_read_dbr()</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> methods, but it is
useful for detailed examination or comparisons of GEM inputs and
results, especially when GEM returns a bad status code. In the latter
case, a more exact error message can be found in the </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">ipmlog.txt</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> file located in the
executable file directory.<br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Any DBR
file can be modified in text editor (see the <a
 href="gemipm2k-inp.html">companion manual</a> for details) and then
used for the next calculation, as described above. Many variants of the
system, e.g. with different bulk compositions, can be prepared as DBR
files and processed in batch mode putting the code sequence above in a
loop. This is demonstrated in the </span><a href="../../main.cpp"><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">main.cpp</span></big></a><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> file in </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">GEMIPM2</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> directory.<br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">However, on
the TNode level, the work DATABR structure can be read or modified
directly in the program memory, which is of course the most interesting
case for coupling GEM with an existing mass transport or reaction-path
modeling code. There are several ways to access data in DATACH and
DATABR or modify data in DATABR - from multi-parameter function calls
to direct memory access via dedicated methods or macroses. Some of
these are used in the </span><a href="../../../node-gem/main.cpp"><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">main.cpp</span></big></a><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> example in </span><big><span

= bc[2];</span></big><br style="font-family: monospace;">
  </div>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Useful
direct-access methods are defined in the public section of TNode class
definition in the </span><a href="../../node.h"><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">node.h</span></big></a><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> file (can be
extended in future versions of GEMIPM2K). <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It is
important to keep in mind that in the TNode class, two systems for
indexation of components and phases are used: one for DATACH/MULTI data
lists and data arrays, and another for the DATABR data arrays. These
two indexation systems are connected via the <a href="#INDEX_MAPPING">index
mapping lists</a> in the DATACH structure. Both indexation systems are
identical only in the trivial one-to-one mapping case when </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">nICb == nICs, nDCb == nDCs, nPHb ==
nPHs</span></big><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">,
i.e. data for all components and phases are exchanged through DATABR
structure or DBR file. In a general case, some components and phases
are not exchanged or transported between nodes, so </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">nICb &lt;= nICs, nDCb &lt;= nDCs, nPHb
&lt;= nPHs</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">. </span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The TNode
class contains methods that search for both kinds of indexes for a
given component or phase name and convert an index of one kind into
another. For instance, the indexes for Ca+2 ion (assuming that it is
present in the DATACH structure list) can be found using the lines
below:<br>
  </span></p>
  <p style="font-family: monospace; margin-left: 40px;"><big>int
xcCa_ion = node-&gt;DC_name_to_xCH("Ca+2");<br>
int xbCa_ion = node-&gt;DC_name_to_xDB("Ca+2");<br>
if( xbCa_ion &lt; 0 )<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; "Error - data for the Ca+2 ion are not
exchanged through DATABR!"; <br>
  </big></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The known
DATABR index of the Ca+2 component can be directly converted into
DATACH index, and vice versa: <br>
  </span></p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">xcCa_ion = DC_xDB_to_xCH( xbCa_ion );</span></big><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
  <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">....................................</span></big><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
  <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">xbCa_ion = DC_xCH_to_xDB(
xcCa_ion );</span></big><br>
  </div>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Similar
methods are also provided for independent components and phases. <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Normally,
the mass transport part of the coupled code should see only the data
accessible via the DATABR interface. For example, the amount of Ca+2 in
the node is simply accessible as&nbsp; </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">dbr-&gt;xDC[xbCa_ion]</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; through DATABR
index of Ca+2. <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">However,
there are some useful numbers (such as molar masses or thermodynamic
properties of chemical species) that are not directly accessible using
the DATABR indexation. For such data, macroses are provided. For the
above example, the molar mass of Ca+2 with DATABR index&nbsp; </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">xbCa_ion </span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">can be obtained as <br>
  </span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">double mmCa_ion = nodeCH_DCmm(
xbCa_ion
); </span></big><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Assuming
that independent component Ca is exchanged in DATABR, the stoichiometry
coefficient of Ca in Ca+2 species can be obtained as <br>
  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">int
xbCa_IC = node-&gt;IC_name_to_xDB( "Ca" );</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">float scCa = nodeCH_A( xbCa_ion,
xbCa_IC );</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The direct
access methods outlined above are especially useful when the transport
algorithm is implemented using TNodeArray class because the transport
part then may not maintain its own data structures for keeping chemical
properties in all nodes. <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">For
coupling with existing transport codes that keep arrays with chemical
speciation for all nodes, the integrated GEMIPM calls are more useful.
Typical sequence of such calls is shown in the </span><a

transport part is allocated in separate vectors or arrays for each

the initial chemical speciation and composition has been distributed
over all nodes, the main loop of mass transport modelling begins.
Whatever the method used for solving transport and mass conservation
equations, this will re-distribute some components of mobile phases

change their bulk compositions at the next time point. All this will be
done on elements of the </span><big><span

  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Next, the
equilibria in every node must be re-calculated in order to correct for
phase assemblage and speciation that may eventually change because of
changed bulk chemical composition, temperature, pressure, or kinetic
constraints e.g. for mineral dissolution or precipitation. The
re-equilibration may change phase volumes or aqueous speciation, which
in turn may change transport between some nodes at the next time step.
So, this "operator-splitting" reactive transport modelling is performed
by alternating transport and chemistry loops over nodes, embedded in
the time integration loop. The code fragment below shows how the
chemistry loop may look like when GEMIPM2K </span><span

  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In the
above code fragment, two kinds of monitoring GEM performance are
exemplified. The total GEM calculation time (in seconds) is collected
in </span><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">CalcTime</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> variable, and&nbsp;
the average number of iterations per GEM call is available at the
end&nbsp; from </span><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">MeanTotIt</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> varilable. Both
performance indicators strongly depends on setup and composition of the
chemical system, as well as on the computer processor and architecture,
as shown in the GEM performance report [<a href="#Ref_Dmytrieva-2008">Dmytrieva
et al., 2008</a>]. However, there is one explicit performance control -
namely, the choice of the mode of <a href="#INITIAL_APPROXIMATION">GEM
initial approximation</a>. <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In the code
fragment, the GEM calculation for each node is requested to start with
the automatic (simplex) initial approximation&nbsp; </span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">NEED_GEM_AIA </span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">mode.&nbsp; In this
mode, GEM calculations are 100% reproducible but rather slow (20 to 200
GEM iterations depending on the chemical system definition and
composition). The alternative mode </span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">NEED_GEM_SIA</span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> (smart initial
approximation) uses the currently available contents of the speciation (</span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">xDC</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">) and activity
coefficients (</span><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">gam</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">) vectors (modified
through the DATABR interface) as the initial approximation. If the xDC
vector for the current node, modified after the mass transport time
step, does not violate the mass balance relative to the current bulk
composition vector bIC, and neither the phase assemblage nor the redox
state are going to change, then GEM is expected to do 0 to 10
iterations, i.e. 10-20 times less than in the automatic initial
approximation (AIA) mode. This acceleration can be relevant for large
2-D or 3-D coupled RMT models. However, the SIA mode result is by
definition not exactly reproducible. Even repeated SIA mode
calculations for the same system always yield slightly different
amounts of dependent components because the previously computed
speciation taken as initial approximation is always slightly different.
Although It is unlikely that this may lead to diverging coupled
modelling results because any GEM-calculated speciation must converge
to the Gibbs energy minimum, the behavior of SIA mode GEM calculation
relative to AIA in coupled models still needs more testing and
verification.<br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Yet the SIA
GEM calculation mode may be preferable over the AIA mode when the
transport program part moves aqueous species. In this case, any changed
chemical speciation in the node is guaranteed to remain mass-balanced
because the corrections to the bulk composition vector bIC are
calculated by the mass transport part from the corrections to xDC
vector. The latter then is a good initial approximation at least in the
sense of mass balance, so the <a href="#EFD_PROCEDURE">GEM EFD()
procedure</a> is not expected to do any extra iterations. In most
meaningful RMT problems, the phase association or redox changes occur
along some distinct reaction fronts or barriers that are represented by
small fraction of the nodes. In such a node it may happen that the
current speciation turns to be a bad GEM initial approximation. The GEM
IPM kernel has several built-in criteria to check if this happens
indeed; if so, then the program "smartly" switches to simplex (AIA)
initial approximation and obtains correct new phase assemblage and
speciation just at cost of performing more iterations. However,&nbsp;
for the vast majority of nodes that lie not in the vicinity of rock
heterogeneities or reaction fronts, slight changes of speciation and
composition upon the transport time iteration would not result in any
phase or redox shifts. In this case, the SIA approximation appears safe
enough and GEM is expected to converge in 1,2 or 3 iterations. For this
kind of the transport problem, three code lines in the above example
can be replaced by the following ones: <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">..............................<br>
// &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; m_NodeStatusCH[in] =
NEED_GEM_AIA;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // GEM Automatic (simplex) initial
approximation</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
m_NodeStatusCH[in] = NEED_GEM_SIA;&nbsp;&nbsp; // GEM Smart initial
approximation</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
UseNodeSpeciation =
true;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// set true for GEM SIA if aqueous species are transported<br>
..............................<br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">UseNodeSpeciation</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> flag, if set to </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">true</span></big><span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">, tells the program
to take the (modified) speciation from xDC vector as the initial
approximation together with the activity coefficients gam (the latter
are usually not modified in the mass transport part). If this flag is
set to false then the xDC and gam vectors will not be copied into the
MULTI structure and instead, the previous contents of the speciation
vector x and activity coefficients lnGam vector will be used as initial
approximation. This may be the only possible SIA mode for pure
advection coupled problems where the whole fluid composition is moved
and not single species. A disadvantage in this case is that the changed
bIC vector is no more compatible with the speciation inherited from
previous node in the sense of mass balance. This may lead to multiple
EFD() iterations or more frequent internal switches to AIA mode, hence
the acceleration of GEM calculations may only be moderate. <br>
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The TNode
class contains several overloaded forms of the GEM_from_MT() function
which loads input data into work DATABR structure before launching the
GEM calculation for a given node. The simplest form does not transfer
the speciation vector at all and can be used when GEM is started in AIA
mode or in SIA mode with </span><big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">UseNodeSpeciation = false.<span
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> The&nbsp; variant
used in the above code example sends xIC,&nbsp; xDC and gam vectors as
they are available in the transport part data arrays. Finally, there is
a call which transmits the xDC vector where the increments in the
species amounts over the time step are given, and the bIC vector
unchanged over the time step. In this case, the TNode class adds the
xDC increments to the previous contents of x vector in the MULTI
structure, computes the bulk composition increments, adds those to bIC
vector in work DATABR structure and copies the contents of bIC&nbsp; to
the b vector of the MULTI structure. In other words, the mass-transport
part is not balancing the bulk composition vector bIC, leaving this
work to the GEMIPM2K program.&nbsp;</span></span></big><span
