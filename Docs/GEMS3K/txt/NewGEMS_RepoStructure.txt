
New arrangement of GEMIPM2K and GEMS3 svn repositories (since 4.Feb.2010)
Aims: to eliminate the redundancy in GEMIPM kernel source code files; 
      to make it easy switching from the "stable" variant of GEMIPM2K to the "upgrade" 
      variant under development also in GEMS3 source code tree, at the same time having 
      only GEMIPM2K repository accessible for people dealing with coupled codes.  

Previous states of the code development are branched into
 
svn+ssh://gems@les-svn.psi.ch/srv/svn/repos/GEMS-PSI/upgrade/gems3 (revision 1526)
svn+ssh://gems@les-svn.psi.ch/srv/svn/repos/GEMIPM2K/feb030210/GEMIPM2K (revision 383)

Step 1: checkout of new svn HEAD repository modules (starting from revisions 1527 and 385)

GEMIPM2K programs:

URL: 

svn+ssh://gems@les-svn.psi.ch/srv/svn/repos/GEMIPM2K/trunk/GEMIPM2K  (official variant)

svn+ssh://gems@les-svn.psi.ch/srv/svn/repos/GEMIPM2K/upgrade/GEMIPM2K  (development variant)

Checkout it (either from "trunk" or from "upgrade" URL) into ...\<work>\standalone\GEMIPM2K

You should have ...\<work>\standalone\GEMIPM2K\*.* where *.* are source code files or test 
data subdirectories. 


GEMS3 GUI Shell + Database Maintenance:

URL:   svn+ssh://gems@les-svn.psi.ch/srv/svn/repos/GEMS-PSI/trunk/gems3

Checkout it into ...\<work>\gems3

You should have ...\<work>\gems3\*.* where *.* are make files or source code subdirectories
such as mods\, kernel\, ... 


Step 2: Building standalone GEMIPM2K program (the list of files did not change): 

as usual before, go into ...\<work>\standalone\GEMIPM2K and 

make -f <Makefile_for_your_platform> 

Those who have Qt4 installed, can produce actual Makefiles by executing in the same directory:

qmake GEMIPM2K.pro

This will produce two makefiles: Makefile.Debug and Makefile.Release. Run for example  

make -f Makefile.Release

Executable file and object files will be created in ...\<work>\standalone\GEMIPM2K\Release\

 
Step 3: Building GEMS3:

If you have a gems_qt.pro.user file, copy it from your old gems3 directory into a newly 
checked-out one. Start Qt-Creator and open project gems_qt.pro in the new gems3 directory.

Build GEMS3 as usual (debug or release variants)

Essential requirement: the \gems3 and \standalone\GEMIPM2K working copy directories must be 
in the same directory \<work>  (where <work> can be any directory name)

  
Step 4: to build GEMS3 with the development GEMIPM2K variant instead of the official one:

rename \standalone\GEMIPM2K into e.g.  \standalone-trunk\GEMIPM2K

Checkout GEMIPM2K from (see details in Step 1) URL: 

svn+ssh://gems@les-svn.psi.ch/srv/svn/repos/GEMIPM2K/upgrade/GEMIPM2K
 
into   ...\<work>\standalone\GEMIPM2K

At some point, the upgrade variant will be merged into trunk variant of GEMIPM2K. 
This will be announced after the agreement of all developer parties involved has been 
reached.
